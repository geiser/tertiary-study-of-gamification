  abstract = {Purpose: Voluntary participation, feedback loops, rules and goals are key elements of total quality management (TQM). The purpose of this paper is to determine if these four elements which make TQM successful are the same elements that make computer games successful. If this is the case, what are the implications for developers of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) in Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a systematic literature review of recent literature on engagement in games and user experiences and HCI design for industry followed by interpretation of the literature. The findings from the literature review are analysed and compared to TQM. Findings: Good game design and TQM share four key components: goals, rules, a feedback system (including rewards) and voluntary participation. There is an opportunity for HCI developers to use a user experience lens inherent in games evolution and to expand on the design and motivational elements that have made games and TQM successful at motivating and engaging. Kuutti's (1995) proposal of activity theory puts forward a promising framework for making systems engaging. There are positive implications merging good games design and TQM in socio-technic systems which could improve engagement and quality in companies implementing in Industy 4.0. Research limitations/implications: The implications of achieving increased engagement in HCI systems similar to those seen in companies that have successfully implemented TQM could lead to greater productivity in companies operating in the highly technical environments of Industry 4.0. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is threefold: first, a description of the origins in industry of voluntary participation, feedback loops, rules and goals and their relationship to TQM; second, a systematic literature review of the same elements in computer games design; and third, the implications for developers of HCI systems in Industry 4.0. \textcopyright{} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of gamification research. It introduces a panoramic research map that comprises a research map and keyword maps for each year of publication of research on gamification. The panoramic research map resulted in a detailed view of gamification research: covered areas, types of published papers, gaps, and most researched themes. The main area of research on gamification is related to the education and training domain, showing a strong connection to the use of game design elements and game experience to improve educational scenarios among students. Knowing the panoramic research map aids the development of future research on gamification, helping in the identification of important papers, gaps in the knowledge, and relevant papers for future research. As an additional outcome, the panoramic research map might also be used to understand other fields of research or specific themes besides gamification. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {14388871},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide shortage of health workers, and this issue requires innovative education solutions. Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. RESULTS: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research. \textcopyright{}Sarah Victoria Gentry, Andrea Gauthier, Beatrice L'Estrade Ehrstrom, David Wortley, Anneliese Lilienthal, Lorainne Tudor Car, Shoko Dauwels-Okutsu, Charoula K Nikolaou, Nabil Zary, James Campbell, Josip Car.

  abstract = {Gamification has gained considerable interest in education circles due to its capability of enhancing the learning process among students. In the future, it is expected that gamification will overtake the traditional way of learning resulting in issues such as scalability, upgradation of learning modules. To address these issues, merging gamification with cloud computing seems a viable solution. However, the employability of gamification through cloud computing is still in its infant stage. Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified. Moreover, a specific cloud-assisted gamification architecture is proposed and discussed together with its possible applications. The article is concluded with the research challenges and suggestions for future work. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Gamification illustrates motivation and encouragement that can be gained by people during using gamified experience. Gamification technology has been successfully applied in several domains including health and fitness, marketing, daily activities and education. It is the strategy which uses heterogeneous game elements within nonentertainment context. As Millennial Generation students have their own needs and preferences, the necessity of having personalized learning is increased recently to boost the effectiveness of the education system. Thus, many researches have investigated how dissimilarities between students can influence their suitable game elements. Since 2010 the published studies on gamification area increased; moreover, some attempts have been made to study the personalization in the gamification model. In this paper, we conducted a review of personalization in gamified learning experience to answer two review questions. We collect, review and synthesize studies related to gamified learning and personalization published from 2010 to 2017. The review strategy included six stages to identify the articles. 13 studies were identified which discussed adopting personalization and gamified learning experience in education. The results show that the studies that apply personalization within gamified learning approach accelerated during the last 3 years. This review reveals the trends in personalization parameters used in the studies, such as student's learning style and personality type. Moreover, most studies have shown high student performance while using the personalized gamified learning experience. \textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract = {While gamification has gained in popularity across different research domains, there is still scarce knowledge on gamification in a servicescape context. The little research that exists in this field does not point in any clear direction. However, further investigation of gamification can provide researchers and practitioners with opportunities to further understand, embed and implement gamification into their marketing activities. To solve these issues, this research reviews contemporary servicescape and gamification literature and conceptualises a framework showing how gamification and its mechanics are linked to the concept of servicescapes and its marketing outcomes. This review highlights gamified mechanics in servicescapes as visible, non-visible and platform dependent. These are shown to influence cognitive and affective responses such as engagement, motion, flow and emotions, which subsequently have impact on long and short-term marketing outcomes. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  title = {What We Know and Need to Know about the Gamification of Advertising: {{A}} Review and Synthesis of the Advergame Studies},
  issn = {03090566},
  abstract = {Purpose: Advergames, or integrated brand messages within digital games, have received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. Despite increased use of advergames as a brand promotion strategy by a range of well-known brands, limited understanding exists about a number of issues related to the effective use of such games. This paper aims to critically review the literature on advergames by performing a detailed analysis of existing research in this area and propose an organizing framework. Based on this framework, the authors discuss key issues with current understanding and propose important questions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This literature review follows Webster and Watson's (2002) concept-driven systematic review methodology elaborating on the key antecedents and consequences identified in advergame studies (what we know: current knowledge), followed by the discussion of key factors that should be investigated as antecedents and consequences (literature gaps). Findings: This paper presents a review and synthesis of advergame studies based on Terlutter and Capella's (2013) integrated marketing communication framework. It identifies game, individual and social factors and suggests how these factors could affect a consumer's brand-related cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral responses. The authors further propose an advergame framework that identifies two different ``unit of analysis'' (antecedents and consequences of game factors and antecedents and consequences of individual and social factors), which can be used by scholars to center their research efforts in a more detailed fashion. Research limitations/implications: Research questions posed in this literature review indicate that future research in the area of advergames should focus on investigating the effects of various game, individual and social factors on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses. Practical implications: The advergame framework provided here provides firms with a guide to the factors that may affect their consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses and helps them in developing effective advergames. Originality/value: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the advergame literature that has not been done before and develops a general advergame framework that can be applied in all contexts and will guide future studies in the area. Overall, the study helps the researchers to identify critical issues and concepts related to advergames and shapes future research in the field. \textcopyright{} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Offering training programs to their employees is one of the necessary tasks that managers must comply with. Training is done mainly to provide up-to-date knowledge or to convey to staff the objectives, history, corporate name, functions of the organization's areas, processes, laws, norms or policies that must be fulfilled. Although there are a lot of methods, models or tools that are useful for this purpose, many companies face with some common problems like employee's motivation and high costs in terms of money and time. In an effort to solve this problem, new trends have emerged in the last few years, in particular strategies related to games, such as serious games and gamification, whose success has been demonstrated by numerous researchers. According to the above, we present a systematic literature review of the different approaches that have used games or their elements, using the procedure suggested by Cooper, on this matter, ending with about the positive and negative findings. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {This systematic literature review aims to (a) understand the current state of gamification as a strategy for improving processes associated with software project management and (b) define future gamification in the context of software project management. For these purposes, we identified and analyzed studies based on research interests, including software project management areas explored with gamification, gamification elements used in this context, research methods, and industry type. Our findings indicate a predominance of studies in project management areas related to integration, resources, and scoping. The most commonly reported research method is the solution proposal, and the most commonly used gamification element is the point system. Future research must focus on addressing unexplored project management areas, which can be intervened with gamification as an improvement strategy to facilitate the implementation of good practices that impact the success of software development projects. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {Gamification has been applied to a large diversity of settings in recent years, with encouraging and promising results. In the Software Engineering context, there are some research works that focused on the application of gamification in Requirements Engineering that need to be better analyzed and understood. Does gamification impact RE? What are the gamification elements that have been used? What sub-processes and RE tasks have been the subject of gamification? The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic review to characterize the state of the art of gamification in RE, answering those and other questions, identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. It was conducted a systematic review to find the primary studies in the existent literature which objectives is applying gamification to RE and its sub-processes. As a result of the systematic review, 8 primary studies were analyzed. They were published between 2012 and 2017 and most of them focus on the application of gamification onto elicitation, negotiation and prioritization. \textcopyright{} 2018 IEEE.},

  title = {A Review of the Applicability of Gamification and Game-Based Learning to Improve Household-Level Waste Management Practices among Schoolchildren},
  volume = {9},
  issn = {20869614},
  abstract = {Knowledge strongly affects attitudes toward waste management; thus, embedding an environmental mentality at a young age is crucial. Game-based interventions, such as gamification and game-based learning, have huge potential to be effective learning tools. This paper examines the potential of gamification to improve waste management practices among schoolchildren through a narrative review of 25 papers on gamification for waste management and gamification for schoolchildren. The effectiveness of game-based learning and gamification in mitigating waste management issues with schoolchildren has not yet been well-described in the literature; however, the evolving market in related sectors is a strong indication of their potential. A robust understanding of social and behavioral theories is necessary for implementing gamification and game-based learning effectively. Additionally, the game elements, design, and mechanics that can achieve the most positive impacts should be explored further. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the body of knowledge in the environmental sector on gamification as an innovative process for improving household-level waste management behavior among schoolchildren. \textcopyright{} IJTech 2018.},

  abstract = {Based on the SSCI sub-database in the Web of Science, this study selected 9 SSCI journals in the field of educational technology as sources of literature to investigate the empirical research of educational games from 2013 to 2017. We used the bibliometric method to analyze and describe the overall development of educational game research. It was found that the research hotspots mainly focus on educational game environment design, educational game effectiveness, learner motivation, and gamification teaching strategies. A content analysis framework was established based on the results of the bibliometric analysis. From the three dimensions of educational game design and development, teaching and application, and educational evaluation, a total of 113 empirical studies were analyzed panoramically. The following characteristics and trends were summarized: (1) design and development: focus on high-quality learning experiences and personalized learning; (2) games used in education: a shift from the perspective of learner characteristics to internal cognition; (3) integration of games and teaching: educational games as the main cognitive tools for the learner-centered classroom; (4) educational evaluation: the continuous exploration of gamification evaluation methods to achieve scientific, interesting, and effective assessment. \textcopyright{} 2018 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

  abstract = {This paper investigated the nursing research related to gamification and analyzed the contents and effects of the experimental research. A systematic literature review was conducted. The articles were searched electronically using the database with the keywords of ``gamification'' or ``gamified'' and ``nursing''. Finally, six studies were selected among 80 studies. The study was conducted mostly by health care professionals including nursing s tudents (n = 4) a nd e ducation s ubjects (n = 5). `Reward' was t he most c ommon gamification mechanism used in the study, and all studies were combined with various gamification mechanisms. In nursing education where participation and motivation of the subject are important, gamification can play an important role in educational effect. Nursing researchers' interest in gamification is needed in the future, and it is necessary to develop scenarios suitable for educational situations and to check their effectiveness. \textcopyright{} Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2018.},

  abstract = {Gamification is an innovative approach that aims to increase users' engagement and motivation and provide sustainable experiences. It has recently become widely known and is an approach that is being used in many fields. This article intends to identify and map trends and patterns in gamification research. For this purpose, this article employs a systematic review in which document and content analysis were used. Research findings have revealed that conceptual/descriptive papers outweigh other type of papers; however, quantitative and qualitative papers are showing an increasing trend. Lexical analysis demonstrated that education, teaching, and learning; engagement, motivation, and behavior change, and gamified designs, are emerging concepts. Keyword analysis revealed that gamification, engagement, and motivation are most frequently used keywords. Gamification articles are mostly related to the education field. Self-Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetic) Framework appeared to be the most beneficial lenses in gamification studies.

  isbn = {978-1-4503-5725-8},
  abstract = {Requirement engineering (RE) presents several challenges stemming from the required collaboration and knowledge transfer between analysists, developers and customers. Motivation theories have been used occasionally to analyze and encourage motivation and engagement of stakeholders in RE tasks. In recent years, gamification techniques have been used in software engineering tasks, and in some cases, in RE tasks in order to promote stakeholder engagement. This paper presents a preliminary literature review that was conducted in order to model correlations documented in literature between RE tasks, stakeholder motivation and engagement, and gamification. The preliminary findings show promise for conducting a full systematic literature review (SLR) in order to complete modeling existing evidence-based literature. The SLR and the emergent model will set the grounds for a research agenda toward an exhaustive model that will offer guidance for designing gamified environments for different RE tasks, based on motivational and behavioral factors. \textcopyright{} 2018 ACM.},

  title = {Gamification and Serious Games in Depression Care: {{A}} Systematic Mapping Study},
  volume = {35},
  issn = {07365853},
  abstract = {Depression is a common mental disorder that causes sadness and loss of interest. It affects 350 million people in the world and its most severe state can lead to suicide. Many technologies are being used to aid the depression treatment and gamification has been used as an approach to improve adherence and engagement in the treatment. This systematic study aimed at identifying how gamification and serious games have been applied to support the treatment of depression, what technologies are being used currently and what gaps are still left unexplored. Eight scientific repositories were used to search for papers in the area of depression and a filter process was used to remove bias. As a result of this search and filter process, 28 works were completely reviewed, analyzed and categorized in this paper. In the reviewed papers the technologies found for treatment of depression were mobile, computer, wearables and web applications. These technologies are applied in gamification, serious games, virtual reality and speech analysis. Some papers used Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as an intervention and other papers used gamification as a way to promote engagement and adherence to treatment. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Mobile technologies and technological advances in behavioral assessment have found their way in common healthcare practices. However, there are still few studies about videogame-based interventions to support concrete psychological treatments. While the market for self-help mobile apps is continuously increasing, in most cases, they are a mere digitalization of texts contained in self-help books and do not take advantage of the interactive and playful potential of devices on which they are offered. Nevertheless, a number of health games have been developed for children and adults for a variety of therapeutic purposes. The current chapter provides an overview of the state-of-the-art serious games currently available as psychological interventions across popular delivery formats (virtual reality environments, online and PC videogames). Where available, evidence about their efficacy is reported. These serious games have the potential to complement traditional psychological interventions and improve psychological wellbeing for people of all ages. \textcopyright{} 2018, IGI Global.},

  abstract = {Gamification refers to the use of game mechanics and game dynamics in non-gaming environments and contexts. Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education. This review also highlights possible interventions that can improve student retention in IS education through the design of effective gamified courses. \textcopyright{} 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.},

  abstract = {Internet users are searching for healthcare-related information at unprecedented rates. However, health researchers and providers have only just begun to utilize new technologies to deliver medical education online and through smartphone-based applications. Gamification, an increasingly popular method to produce positive behavioral change, has become a source of interest for private industry as well as academic researchers. In this review, we conducted literature searches to provide an initial framework for researchers to classify gamification studies. We provide a short list of popular gamification elements to help develop a definition for gamification in healthcare. \textcopyright{} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature},

  abstract = {Gamification systems have the potential to foster students' engagement and enhance their learning performance. Although the literature to date has provided relevant contributions in explaining how gamification design can be effective, several studies seek to address the constructs used to measure the effects of gamification. To analyze how gamification outcomes should be properly measured, this paper systematically reviews the literature and provides a map of the most frequent scales used to measure gamification outcomes in the educational context. As research findings, we identify motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and flow/cognitive absorption as the primary constructs addressed to experiential outcomes. Additionally, there are research opportunities to develop a better understanding of the effects of extrinsic motivation rewards on experiential outcomes and problem-solving transfer posited as instrumental outcome. \textcopyright{} International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Researchers and practitioners alike increasingly recognize gamification as a potential tool to evoke desired behaviours in patients, healthcare professionals, and healthy end-users aiming to live a healthier lifestyle. Thus, the number of scientific publications in healthcare gamification is rapidly increasing and due to the interdisciplinary nature of the research field, knowledge about this topic is being scattered over many research communities. Building on a large number of articles on healthcare gamification and utilizing citation network analysis, this study sheds further light on the extant knowledge on healthcare gamification. Based on our approach, we were able to (1) evaluate essential articles and authors covering the topic, (2) analyse the recent development of research on healthcare gamification, and (3) identify past research foci and knowledge gaps in our knowledge on healthcare gamification. By doing so, we call for further research on healthcare gamification and provide researchers with potential avenues for future research projects. \textcopyright{} 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

  title = {Gamification Applied for Health Promotion: {{Does}} It Really Foster Long-Term Engagement? {{A}} Scoping Review},
  abstract = {Gamification is a popular design approach with the purpose to increase engagement and continuous use of Health Behaviour Change Support Systems (HBCSS) with the purpose to establish health and wellbeing. It is widely employed for promoting healthier life choices or for supporting people with chronic diseases in their daily activities. Yet, there is a lack of evidence concerning gamification and its ability to sustain favourable effects on health behaviour change. This paper presents a scoping review about the long-term perspective in gamified HBCSS, focusing primarily on IT-reliant systems that treat individual lifestyle habits like healthy nutrition, exercise or smoking cessation. We systematically selected studies that consider gamified HBCSS for health promotion and discuss to what extent long-term engagement is explicitly included in their design. Our results underline a deficit of consideration of the long-term perspective as well as a lack of measurement related to the lasting effects of gamification. We therefore propose to intensify the use of longitudinal and prospective observational studies in the context of HBCSS, in order to increase the level of evidence of gamification interventions. \textcopyright{} 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

  abstract = {The quality of teaching is becoming increasingly important for the success of any institution regardless of the level of education. In this context, gamification is a tool often used to improve the teaching-learning process by helping both teachers and students reach their goals in the short, medium and long term. Given its importance both for the academia and for society in general, this article wishes to do a systematic review of the literature on the use of gamification as a tool to enhance the quality of the teaching process, in general, and, in particular, the teaching of management. In order to do so, it will focus on the most relevant literature on the application of gamification to educational contexts, while describing gamification's main themes and constructs, using a systematic approach based on a research protocol and refinement criteria that include precise research and literature review stages, resorting to scientific articles that have been published and are part of the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases. The paper concludes by proposing a research model based on four main constructs derived from this systematic literature review in order to help futures studies about gamification in education. \textcopyright{} 2018, Dechema e.V.

  title = {A Review of Gamification Approaches in Commercial Cognitive Bias Modification Gaming Applications},
  volume = {26},
  issn = {09287329},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive biases are mostly automatic processes that result in individuals giving increased attention to threatening stimuli, with the difficulties in disengaging from these stimuli. Recent reviews have reported the presence for attention bias in several psychiatric conditions and provided evidence that such biases could be subjected to modification.Web-based and mobile based bias modification have mixed efficacy and gamification techniques proposed as a solution. There remains a gap in knowledge pertaining to the gamified applications for bias modification that are commercially available. OBJECTIVE: An analysis of their gamification approach will help in identification of common gaming elements adopted for use. METHODS: To identify commercial applications, a manual cross-sectional search was conducted between 1 and 11 November 2017 on the Google Play store. The following search terminologies were used: "Attention bias" and "Cognitive bias". The classification of the gamification technique for both the published applications and commercial applications were based on the six approaches described by Wouter et al. [17] and the 17 gamification techniques described by Hoffman et al. [18]. RESULTS: A total of nine applications were included in the current review. Five out of the nine applications involved the addition of gaming elements to an evidence-based task, and three involved the usage of intrinsic integration while leaving the evidence-based task intact. Other common gamification strategies used are that of the inclusion of digital rewards (n = 8) and the provision of feedback (n = 7). The average number of gamification techniques across all the nine applications is 3.2. CONCLUSIONS: Even though most commercial applications appear to have their basis on a validated gamification approach for the delivery of attention bias modification, there remains a need for further research in evaluating these applications clinically. \textcopyright{} 2018 IOS Press and the authors.

  title = {A Systematic Literature Review on the Gamification Monitoring Phase: {{How SPI}} Standards Can Contribute to Gamification Maturity},
  volume = {918},
  issn = {18650929},
  abstract = {Gamification is a novel concept that has attracted the attention of many research fields, including software engineering, software process improvement or software process standards education as an approach to increase productivity, engagement, and motivation of participants involved in a system, site or business. However, gamification is a relative new concept that needs to deal with many problems in order to consolidate and mature its understanding and process. The main goal of this study is to explore the gamification scope with the goal to identify its problems and needs, focusing on the monitoring process of gamification strategies. A systematic literature review was performed following a predefined procedure that involves automatically searching in scientific digital databases. 383 papers were found by the automatic searches in the digital databases and only 2 papers were selected as primary studies. Outcomes show that there is a clear scope of research on the road to provide tools for monitoring high-scalable gamified systems that support gamification experts on gamification analytics and end-users on getting real-time feedback, as well as, a need to mature the gamification process that can be supported by taking advantages from other disciplines, especially from the scope of process capability and maturity. \textcopyright{} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

  issn = {01482963},
  abstract = {This article presents a review of the current body of academic literature concerning gamification of production and logistics to understand the status quo and provide suggestions for future research. The findings indicate that the execution and control of production and logistic processes has been addressed most often in the current body of literature, which mostly consists of design research. Objectives and goals, points, achievements, multimedial feedback, metaphorical or fictional representations, and levels and progress are currently the most often employed affordances within this field. Research has focused in the given context on examining or considering motivation, enjoyment and flow, as the main psychological outcomes of gamification, while individual performance and efficiency are the most commonly examined or suggested behavioral and organizational impacts. Future studies should employ more rigorous designs within new subdomains of production and logistics and should firmly ground research designs and discussions in management theory and critical studies. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors},

  title = {Gamification of Education and Learning: {{A}} Review of Empirical Literature},
  volume = {2186},
  abstract = {Gamification has become one of the most notable technological developments for human engagement. Therefore, it is not surprising that gamification has especially been addressed and implemented in the realm of education where supporting and retaining engagement is a constant challenge. However, while the volume of research on the topic has increased, synthesizing the consequent knowledge has remained modest and narrow. Therefore, in this literature review we catalogue 128 empirical research papers in the field of gamification of education and learning. The results indicate that gamification in education and learning most commonly utilizes affordances signaling achievement and progression, while social and immersion-oriented affordances are much less common; the outcomes examined in the studies are mainly focused on quantifiable performance metrics; and the results reported in the reviewed studies are strongly positively oriented. The findings imply that future research on gamification in education should increasingly put emphasis on varying the affordances in the implementations and the pursued goals of the gamification solutions. We encourage also increased attention on contextual factors of the solutions as well as on study designs in future research endeavors. \textcopyright{} 2018 CEUR-WS. All Rights Reserved.},

  title = {Elements of Gamification in Virtual Learning Environments: {{A}} Systematic Review},
  volume = {716},
  issn = {21945357},
  abstract = {Information technologies have introduced several changes in teaching and learning environments. In this scenario, the gamification technique emerges as a promising approach, considering the impact on the students' motivation and appealing to their participation. This paper describes a systematic review addressing gamification in virtual learning environments (VLE), presenting an overview on how gamification has been applied in these scenarios. This review was based on papers published in highly scored journals in the field of computers in education. The papers were selected according to the gamification theme, and the content was analyzed and a state of the art built, according to the retrieved qualitative data. The results seem to reveal that there are significant gains derived from the adoption of gamification in VLE. However, some gains are not unanimous and it depends on how the elements are applied. This paper also suggests a basis for future work aiming at applying gamification in a VLE. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

  title = {The Effect of Gamification on Motivation and Engagement},
  volume = {35},
  issn = {20564880},
  abstract = {Purpose: Gamification is the application of game features, mainly video game elements, into non-game context for the purpose of promoting motivation and engagement in learning. The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners' motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Themes covered in the literature review include: conceptualizing gamification, advantages of gamification over game-based learning, theoretical connections to gamification, motivation and engagement, connecting gamification to motivation and engagement, emotions and fun in gamification, player types and gamification features, gamification in action, and implementation guidelines. Findings: The literature on the effect of gamification on motivation and gamification is still limited on multiple levels. There is a gap between theory and practice in the study of gamification. There is limited literature on the implementation guidelines of the gamified designs. Practical implications: This critical analysis of literature is followed by connecting it to future research by the same author as part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. The second project, will be proposing a methodology for any successful design to provide a holistic understanding of the topic of gamification. Finally, an empirical study on the effect of gamification on students' motivation and engagement in three college courses will be submitted to complete the trilogy. Originality/value: This paper is a literature review, so there is a strong connection to literature on this topic. However, the synthesis of the themes and ideas are original. The literature review is extensive and covers the different aspects of the topic of gamification and its relationship to motivation and engagement. \textcopyright{} 2018, \textcopyright{} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Learner's motivation difficulties are recognized as a problem in diverse educational scenarios, reaching up to university degrees. Among other techniques that are often applied by instructors to counteract this issue, those related to the use of gaming elements seem to very promising. In this context, considering the use of game-like properties in learning scenarios, known as gamification, has received increasing interest by academia in recent years. However, its application in higher education can be challenging, due to some unwanted effects caused by the lack of proven design methodologies have been detected. Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers. A total of 2314 unique works are initially recorded, based on queries in databases, libraries, journals and search engines. After applying a systematic filtering process, a definitive list of 40 works is more closely analysed. Next to review over relevant literature, an assessment of the main features found in the discussed approaches is given, while also categorizing them according to their main application field and its suitability in higher educational environments. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {Gamification of education is a developing approach for increasing learners' motivation and engagement by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers' understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach. \textcopyright{} 2017, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The presence of gaming natives has drawn our concern on their response to gamification in education and effect of gamified learning material. This study intends to critically review pitfalls and criticism of gamification in education, particularly on the evil side of simplification, essence of hedonic feelings of game, and effect on learning motivation for the purpose of shedding light on how to enhance its existing engagement model. In addition, this paper also pinpoints common fallacy of pursuing gamification among educators and practitioners and challenges faced by gamification designers. Throughout the review, it is suspected that affluent gaming experience could dampen the effectiveness of gamification and future research endeavour is called for validating such effect. \textcopyright{} 2017 IETE.},

  abstract = {Game the word chronicles everything to the world. Game plays an important role in the area of network as there is a technological improvement in coalitional game. A game interacts with the user through user interface and produces audio-video effects so as to make the world of gaming interesting to the users in the real world. This study proposes a research on gaming and its growth over coalitional game in the internet. This could expound us the change and evolution taken place in the technology over decades. The idea is that with the guidance of game theory we could interpret how Gamification works and what are effects over users (physically and mentally) by playing the game. \textcopyright{} IAEME Publication.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-5111-9},
  abstract = {Gamification has been repeatedly framed as an emerging multidisciplinary research field. However, it is unclear how multidisciplinary the field actually is. To answer this question, this paper presents initial results of a broader scoping review of gamification research published between 2010 and 2016. Close to 2,000 peer-reviewed English-language journal and conference papers were identified across 11 databases and categorized by discipline. Results indicate an explosive growth of literature peaking in 2015. Early on, Information and Computing Science dominated the field, to be overtaken by the sum of other disciplines in 2013, education, economics and tourism in specific. This indicates that gamification was initially a field within computer science and HCI and has only recently become truly multi-disciplinary. \textcopyright{} 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

  abstract = {The advent of information and communication technology provides the opportunity and convenience to anyone to be able to follow online-based learning, so that teaching and learning can be arranged without limits of space and time. Today, online-based learning is offered by many higher education institutions and commercial industries. A variety of strategies to increase student motivation approach on online-based learning has been studied, one of them by using gamification approach. Previous researches were found to adopt motivational theories to stimulate the intrinsic and extrinsic level of gamification approach in education, According to the promise of gamification to enhance the intrinsic motivation of students based on elements of motivation through online-based learning, in this research, we focus on examining; 1) How the application of gamification in online-based learning is, 2) what game design elements that exist in the gamified-based online learning are, and 3) how to increase student motivation in gamified-online learning based on intrinsic motivation elements. The results of our study showed that gamification on online based learning increased, both regarding to utilization, approaches, methods, testing and determination of game design elements are used. Gamification also gave positive impact on student motivation in learning, although it depended on various factors and conditions. We provided reviews and examples based on the literature for the designer in determining the game design elements based on intrinsic motivation elements in the online-based learning. \textcopyright{} 2005 \textendash{} ongoing JATIT \& LLS.},

  abstract = {The use of games in non-leisure contexts is referred to as serious games. The tradition of using games for purposes beyond entertainment goes back a long time before digital games. However, with the advent of digital games, serious games development has become an issue of both game design and technology development in various combinations. This paper presents a literature review of what types of topics are studied in the realm of serious games development, and contrasts the results with challenges and problems expressed by a panel of developers and researchers in serious games and gamification to identify research gaps. Our findings indicate a lack of research on the actual usage situations of serious games. It seems that the phase of organizational deployment and use is most often overseen. Furthermore, we identified a lack of client/customer perspective in most research on the development of gamified solutions. \textcopyright{} 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Two parallel phenomena are gaining attention in human\textendash{}computer interaction research: gamification and crowdsourcing. Because crowdsourcing's success depends on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing, and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects of the phenomenon. The paper's main contributions are derived through a systematic literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Purpose of review: Although there has been a significant increase in mHealth interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum, interventions using game mechanics have been less explored. Digital games are rapidly becoming an important tool for improving health behaviors and supporting the delivery of care and education. The purpose of this review is to provide a historical context for the use of gamification and videogames (including those using virtual reality) used in technology-based HIV interventions and to review new research in the field. Recent findings: A review of recently published (1 January 2016-31 March 2017) or presented abstracts (2016) identified a paucity of technology-based interventions that included gamification elements or any terms associated with videogames or gameplay. A larger portfolio of digital gaming interventions is in the pipeline. Summary: Use of digital games that include elements of gamification or consist of standalone videogames or virtual-reality-based games, represent a promising intervention strategy to address the HIV prevention and care continuum, especially among youth. Our review demonstrates that there is significant room for growth in this area in designing, developing, testing and most importantly, implementation and dissemination these novel interventions.

  abstract = {Serious games and gamification to engage consumers in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency are in their infancy. To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  title = {A Systematic Review of Gamification in E-{{Health}}},
  volume = {71},
  issn = {15320464},
  abstract = {Gamification is a relatively new trend that focuses on applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to engage audiences and to inject a little fun into mundane activities besides generating motivational and cognitive benefits. While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Game applications for purposes such as education, finance or health have attracted considerable interest. However, development of these gameful applications is not adequately supported by knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of game engagement. In this paper, to study game engagement, we review existing theories about game engagement. There are many theoretical studies on game engagement scattered across different disciplines, but they have not been organized into a focused study of game engagement. By synthesizing and organizing this information, a comprehensive account of game engagement can be developed. \textcopyright{} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Many researchers have given priority to the stimulation feature of the games. This concept can be stated to be not only as old as human history but also one of the trend activities. Therefore, many researchers have recently concentrated their attention on the term ''gamification". This term, which includes using the stimulating components of the games out of the game context, has provided items like badges, grading/scoring systems and leadership tables in the work and learning processes. Mostly, it increases stimulation level in the work and learning processes. When the important potential of gamification has been noticed, the number of gamificationintegrated applications has rapidly increased in both work and learning processes of individuals from various age groups. In this regard, this paper aims to review the literature in order to find out how and where gamification could be used in the management processes of open and distance learning systems. \textcopyright{} 2018, IGI Global.

  abstract = {The term ``gamification'' is used for a wide variety of techniques aimed to increase respondent engagement while filling out web surveys. Suggested approaches range from rephrasing questions to sound more game-like to embedding the entire survey into a game where respondent avatars adventure through a fantasy land while answering survey questions. So far, only a few experimental studies regarding the influence of gamification on survey responding have been published in peer-reviewed journals. This article systematically reviews the current research literature on gamification in surveys by first answering the question as to what gamification entails in the context of web surveys by identifying relevant gamification elements. Next, the article discusses how these elements could influence survey data quality using the Total Survey Error framework. Finally, a systematic review of empirical evidence on gamified surveys from published and unpublished studies is provided. While most studies found in our literature review reported a positive effect of using game elements, such as challenges, story/narrative, rewards, goals/objectives, and badges, on psychological outcomes among survey respondents (e.g., fun, interest, satisfaction), the influence of these elements on behavioral outcomes (e.g., completion and break-offs, item omission, satisficing, responses) and, therefore, survey quality is more unclear. This article informs survey researchers and practitioners of the current state of research on survey gamification and identifies potential areas for future research. \textcopyright{} 2015, \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2015.},

  title = {Does Gamification Increase Engagement with Online Programs? {{A}} Systematic Review},
  volume = {12},
  issn = {19326203},
  abstract = {Background: Engagement in online programs is difficult to maintain. Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will answer the following question, 'Are gamification strategies effective in increasing engagement in online programs?' Method: Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where "population" included adults, "intervention" involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. "Comparator" was a control group, "outcomes" included engagement and "downstream" outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and "study design" included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95\% confidence intervals) were also calculated. Results: 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n =5), volume of contributions (n =11) and occasions visited to the software (n =4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n =4) and healthy behaviours (n =1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification. Conclusion: Gamification is effective in increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research into gamification are provided. In particular, rigorous study designs are required to fully examine gamification's effects and determine how to best achieve sustained engagement. \textcopyright{} 2017 Looyestyn et al.

  abstract = {With the rapid evolution and growing complexity of infocommunication devices it is important to discuss gamification, which is exponentially used in several types of infocommunication devices. The paper is about gamification, that recently became a new phenomenon to motivate and alter favorably the behavior of the users. Gamification is a new tool for boosting user engagement in various fields. First the definition, then the elements, later a descriptive gamification model is going to be introduced. Furthermore, information about the connection between motivation and gamification can be understood. In the second part of the article examples of applied gamification in the focus of smartphone applications are going to be given. \textcopyright{} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Playfulness supports people in learning. This study synthesizes a framework for playfulness for one particular type of learning: responsible research and innovation (RRI) reflection processes. Playfulness design elements were extracted from literature about playfulness in various learning and reflection contexts, by inductive coding of playfulness conceptualizations, playful tool(s) descriptions and their effects. We extracted four activity principles\textendash{}narration, imagination, action-reflection and co-creation\textendash{}and three playfulness process requirements\textendash{}experimentation space, focus and stimulating guidance. Due to the utilized database search queries, important articles about RRI reflection processes are possibly overlooked. Also, overlaps between the design elements and gamification may exist. Last, their suitability for adults, offline and hybrid reflection processes require further investigation. We translate each playfulness design element into the context of RRI reflection processes and advise on how to use them in designing playful reflection processes, which can prove their anticipated fruitfulness. Nevertheless, due to the utilized database search queries, important articles about RRI reflection processes are possibly overlooked. Also, overlaps between the design elements and gamification may exist. Therefore, their suitability for adults, offline and hybrid reflection processes require further investigation. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Over the last 10 years, research on gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has increased in the field of education, due to its potential to enhance learning performance. Yet, the majority of available research rather focuses on the evaluation of motivation and engagement as key dependent variables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to review available studies on gamification, with an exclusive focus on learning performance as the key dependent variable. Through a systematic search and selection process, building on "Web of Science" articles and by considering studies between 2000 and 2016 related to gamification and learning, 582 articles were identified. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria, regarding setting (education), study focus (empirical), journal access (full access) and dependent variables (learning performance), resulted in a review of 23 articles meeting the criteria. The analysis of these articles showed how gamification could be linked to a direct increase in learning performance of students. Nevertheless, some studies also reflect weaker statistical differences between being involved or not in a gamified environment. The review analysis results are especially helpful to define a future agenda for gamification research, addressing the following gaps in the literature. First, include mediating and moderating variables to find more empirical research that can prove an indirect effect of gamification on learning performance. Second, carry out additional research that empirically underpins the direct linkage between gamification and learning performance. Third, include specific individual gamification elements to be able to determine explicit differential effects of these elements on learning performance. Fourth, conduct research in a broader range of knowledge fields to develop empirical evidence in the context of other knowledge domains next to computer sciences. Finally, consider involving larger sample and setting up longer experimental interventions, to avoid novelty effects and risks of lack of generalization.},

  abstract = {The software development process is a set of socio-technical activities to produce software artifacts in which humans play a crucial role. Since it is a people centric activity, factors such as user motivation, engagement, communication and collaboration might constrain these activities. Therefore, software business organizations stand to benefit from adopting different tools and methods in order to overcome these obstacles and to improve their software business processes. Research has been made to increase software quality and enhance the software development process. Alongside these studies, innovative techniques and concepts are beneficial. As a solution, the notion of gamification (i.e. employing game elements in non-gaming contexts) has been introduced to enhance the software development process and overcome the challenges mostly related to human factors. However, the applicability of game elements in the context of software business landscapes is still a controversial issue and not totally proven as of yet. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the benefits of gamification and how game elements affect the software development process. Thus, in this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted in order to investigate the application of game elements both in research and industrial levels of software development and as well as in software business landscapes. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract = {Although MOOCs are being established as a very popular technology to support learning, they are often criticized for their lack of support to active pedagogies and the high drop-out rates. One approach to face this problem is gamification, due to the promising benefits already shown at small-scale environments. Attending to the current and growing use of game elements in MOOCs, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the usage of gamification in MOOCs, aimed at analyzing how gamification is being implemented in MOOCs, and to identify unexplored research opportunities in this field. The results show that gamification is still at an early stage in MOOCs, and it is being implemented in similar ways to those at small scale contexts. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  volume = {10429 LNCS},
  issn = {03029743},
  abstract = {As urban planning processes are often complex and protracted, fostering public participation in this sector has to be seen as a major challenge. Nevertheless, previous research on that topic offers various solutions that aim to tackle that problem, either by focusing on playful formats or on gamification and serious gaming. Often examined separately, these approaches deliver promising strengths to improve public participation in the urban sphere. Hence, a synopsis of those strategies seems to be worthwhile and is therefore further investigated in this paper. In order to analyze current works on that issue systematically, the paper is structured via a literature-based classification of different stages of public participation that distinguish whether citizens are being informed, consulted or collaborated with during the planning process. By giving an insight on innovative participation tools and methods in this field, the pursued outcome of this article are impulses for designing an advanced participatory platform which is part of the research project U\textsubscript{C}ODE (Urban Collective Design Environment). \textcopyright{} 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

  abstract = {Gamification has increasingly been applied to various life domains and environments, including work and the workplace. Accordingly, research on gamification has grown considerably in the past years. This study presents a systematic review of the theoretical and empirical literature produced in the past 11 years about the application of gamification to the work domain. We analyze the available literature about why gamification is important in work and human resources management, how it can be guided, and which are the examples of gamification in this domain. The systematic review was based on 35 articles, including theoretical papers, empirical (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods) studies, case studies, and other types of papers (presentation of new resources for gamification). Findings are summarized in terms of the sample, country of the study, study type, main results, and gamification and work dimen sions associated. The results show that research on the applications of gamifica tion in the workplace is scarce and mostly exploratory. Most studies were conducted using quantitative methods, but with small samples and simple research designs. Although the literature suggests evidence for the usefulness and appropriateness of gamification in the workplace, there are significant limitations in the research, translating a gap between HR practitioners' concerns and academic developments in this field. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  title = {The Use of Gamification in Education: A Bibliometric and Text Mining Analysis},
  volume = {32},
  issn = {02664909},
  abstract = {The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010\textendash{}2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this: This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners: Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. Topics and themes under research. Methods used to research the use of games in education. \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

The paper review some of the empirical studies that are conducted in an educational setting to test the effectiveness of specific game design elements on certain psychological outcomes such as motivation, attitude and enjoyment or Inrhavioral outcomes. Results indicated that different game elements can promote different cognitive and/or social motivational alTordances depending on the aim of using the element and the context where it has been used. Understanding cognitive and social motivational alTordances of gamification can help educators and instructional designers to design effective gamified online courses that can invoke both cognitive and social outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background Compared to traditional persuasive technology and health games, gamification is posited to offer several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being, and increasingly used. Yet little is known about its effectiveness. Aims We aimed to assess the amount and quality of empirical support for the advantages and effectiveness of gamification applied to health and well-being. Methods We identified seven potential advantages of gamification from existing research and conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies on gamification for health and well-being, assessing quality of evidence, effect type, and application domain. Results We identified 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and well-being. 59\% reported positive, 41\% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes. Conclusions The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. However several studies report mixed or neutral effect. Findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations of many studies (e.g., a lack of comparison of gamified interventions to non-gamified versions of the intervention). \textcopyright{} 2016},

  title = {Gamification for Health Promotion: Systematic Review of Behaviour Change Techniques in Smartphone Apps},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {20446055},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Smartphone games that aim to alter health behaviours are common, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve this. We systematically reviewed health apps containing gaming elements analysing their embedded behaviour change techniques. METHODS: Two trained researchers independently coded apps for behaviour change techniques using a standard taxonomy. We explored associations with user ratings and price. DATA SOURCES: We screened the National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library and all top-rated medical, health and wellness and health and fitness apps (defined by Apple and Google Play stores based on revenue and downloads). We included free and paid English language apps using 'gamification' (rewards, prizes, avatars, badges, leaderboards, competitions, levelling-up or health-related challenges). We excluded apps targeting health professionals. RESULTS: 64 of 1680 (4\%) health apps included gamification and met inclusion criteria; only 3 of these were in the NHS Library. Behaviour change categories used were: feedback and monitoring (n=60, 94\% of apps), reward and threat (n=52, 81\%), and goals and planning (n=52, 81\%). Individual techniques were: self-monitoring of behaviour (n=55, 86\%), non-specific reward (n=49, 82\%), social support unspecified (n=48, 75\%), non-specific incentive (n=49, 82\%) and focus on past success (n=47, 73\%). Median number of techniques per app was 14 (range: 5-22). Common combinations were: goal setting, self-monitoring, non-specific reward and non-specific incentive (n=35, 55\%); goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success (n=33, 52\%). There was no correlation between number of techniques and user ratings (p=0.07; rs=0.23) or price (p=0.45; rs=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Few health apps currently employ gamification and there is a wide variation in the use of behaviour change techniques, which may limit potential to improve health outcomes. We found no correlation between user rating (a possible proxy for health benefits) and game content or price. Further research is required to evaluate effective behaviour change techniques and to assess clinical outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015029841.

  title = {Gamification {{Solutions}} to {{Enhance Software User Engagement}}\textemdash{{A Systematic Review}}},
  volume = {32},
  issn = {10447318},
  abstract = {Gamification is the use of video-game mechanics and elements in nongame contexts to enhance user engagement and performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards ``in-game'' and ``out-game.'' \textcopyright{} 2016 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {The conception of the term gamification has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners, it is still unclear with proliferation of groundless arguments, and no work to date has surveyed as a study from a healthcare perspective. This study correlates the existing arguments from academic researches and healthcare practices into a systematic review. The focus is on assessing the findings of the quality literatures, such that the predecessors' contributions of applying gamification to healthcare system are illuminated. The findings show that the development of gamification for healthcare system is still preliminary; the most popular research topic is to motivate users by a human-computer interface with a game element such as points. We discuss the results along with an identification of opportunities for future research as a contribution of this systematic review. We suggest that gamification can be more than gaming; it can be a mechanism to enable happier working experience for medical works. \textcopyright{} 2015 IEEE.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-4031-1},
  abstract = {Engagement is a key reason for introducing gamification to learning and thus serves as an important measurement of its effectiveness. Based on a literature review and meta-synthesis, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework of engagement in gamification for learning. The framework sketches out the connections among gamification strategies, dimensions of engagement, and the ultimate learning outcome. It also elicits other task - and user - related factors that may potentially impact the effect of gamification on learner engagement. To verify and further strengthen the framework, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that: 1) different gamification strategies can trigger different facets of engagement; 2) the three dimensions of engagement have varying effects on skill acquisition and transfer; and 3) task nature and learner characteristics that were overlooked in previous studies can influence the engagement process. Our framework provides an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of gamification for learning, and can serve as a theoretical foundation for future research and design. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2016 ACM.},

  abstract = {Rewards are commonly used in interventions to change behavior, but they can inhibit development of intrinsic motivation, which is associated with long-term behavior maintenance. Gamification is a novel intervention strategy that may target intrinsic motivation through fun and enjoyment. Before the effects of gamified interventions on motivation can be determined, there must be an understanding of how gamified interventions operationalize rewards, such as point systems. The purpose of this review is to determine the prevalence of different reward types, specifically point systems, within gamified interventions. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles. Data sources included Medline OVID, Medline PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and PsycINFO. Out of the 21 articles retrieved, 18 studies described a reward system and were included in this review. Gamified interventions were designed to target a myriad of clinical outcomes across diverse populations. Rewards included points (n = 14), achievements/badges/medals (n = 7), tangible rewards (n = 7), currency (n = 4), other unspecified rewards (n = 3), likes (n = 2), animated feedback (n = 1), and kudos (n = 1). Rewards, and points in particular, appear to be a foundational component of gamified interventions. Despite their prevalence, authors seldom described the use of noncontingent rewards or how the rewards interacted with other game features. The reward systems relying on tangible rewards and currency may have been limited by inhibited intrinsic motivation. As gamification proliferates, future research should explicitly describe how rewards were operationalized in the intervention and evaluate the effects of gamified rewards on motivation across populations and research outcomes. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how different gamification implementations can increase crowdsourcees' motivation and participation in crowdsourcing (CS). To this end, we review empirical literature that has investigated the use of gamification in crowdsourcing settings. Overall, the results of the review indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation. When comparing crowdcreating, -solving, -processing and-rating CS approaches, the results show differences in the use of gamification across CS types. Crowdsourcing initiatives that provide more monotonous tasks most commonly used mere points and other simpler gamification implementations, whereas CS initiatives that seek for diverse and creative contributions have employed gamification in more manifold ways employing a richer set of mechanics. These findings provide insights for designers of gamified systems and further research on the topics of gamification and crowdsourcing. \textcopyright{} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {To ensure proper competence development and short graduation times for engineering students, it is essential that the study motivation is encouraged by new learning methods. In game-based learning, the learner's engagement is increased and learning is made meaningful by applying game-like features such as competition and rewarding through virtual promotions or achievement badges. In this paper, the state of the art of game-based learning in building services engineering education at university level is reviewed and discussed. A systematic literature review indicates that educational games have been reported in the field of related disciplines, such as mechanical and civil engineering. The development of system-level educational games that realistically simulate work life in building services engineering is still in its infancy. Novel rewarding practices and more comprehensive approaches entailing the state-of-the-art information tools such as building information modelling, geographic information systems, building management systems and augmented reality are needed in the future. \textcopyright{} 2015 SEFI.},

  abstract = {One of the main tensions in both media studies and education studies can be found in the discourse on the impact of digital media on audiences and learners as connected to a dichotomy of risks and affordances. Contemporary forms of media literacy build on multiple forms of literacy to support critical analysis and critical production in a variety of forms as central to learning. This study reviews research on games and learning conducted from 2010-2016 and published in SAGE Publications, ACM publications, iEEE, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases from a sample of 52 peer reviewed articles. The review of the literature analyzes variables such as authorship, paradigms and learning theories, research questions and methodologies and type of the games used in game-based learning. The central research questions for this literature review build on a history of games for learning and seek to identify good practices that can be used to design meaningful learning experiences and to inform future research related to game-based learning. \textcopyright{} 2016, Journal of Content, Community \& Communication.},

  abstract = {Food-related games and gamified services is an area that has still received relatively little attention in scientific research. In our literature review, we find out that the scientific literature in this domain examines the phenomenon from the point of view of marketing, educative purposes of healthier living, and healthcare. Particular topics often being in the focus are weight management for children and advergaming as a promotional channel towards young people. Commonly, studies conclude that gamification has an effect in bringing a change in the behavior of the targeted user. However, the studies are currently able to present results based only on short-Term empirical experiments or the experiments are even missing. In order to receive more reliable data about the true effectiveness of gamification, longer-Term experiments would be needed. \textcopyright{} 2016 Larian Studios. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The research purpose of the paper is to define the gamification impact on consumer brand engagement. Gamification concept refers to the use of game elements in non-game contexts. Based on the literature review, the gamification is analysed through gamification pyramid approach. According to various researchers, the game mechanics and game components are considered as most influential gamification techniques. Literature review reveals three dimensions of consumer brand engagement: cognitive, emotional and behaviour. The gamification of organisational activities servesas stimuli and drive consumer brand engagement. The findings of empirical survey on the impact of gamification on consumer brand engagement in Lithuanian market prove that gamification is positively relatedto consumer brand engagement, but the relation is rather weak. \textcopyright{} Vilnius University, 2002-2016 \textcopyright{} Brno University of Technology, 2002-2016 \textcopyright{} University of Latvia, 2002-2016.},

  abstract = {Background: Medical education is rapidly evolving. Students enter medical school with a high level of technological literacy and an expectation for instructional variety in the curriculum. In response, many medical schools now incorporate technology- enhanced active learning and multimedia education applications. Education games, medical mobile applications, and virtual patient simulations are together termed gamified training platforms. Objective: To review available literature for the benefits of using gamified training platforms for medical education (both preclinical and clinical) and training. Also, to identify platforms suitable for these purposes with links to multimedia content. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature, commercially published media, and grey literature were searched to compile an archive of recently published scientific evaluations of gamified training platforms for medical education. Specific educational games, mobile applications, and virtual simulations useful for preclinical and clinical training were identified and categorized. Available evidence was summarized as it related to potential educational advantages of the identified platforms for medical education. Results: Overall, improved learning outcomes have been demonstrated with virtual patient simulations. Games have the potential to promote learning, increase engagement, allow for real-word application, and enhance collaboration. They can also provide opportunities for risk-free clinical decision making, distance training, learning analytics, and swift feedback. A total of 5 electronic games and 4 mobile applications were identified for preclinical training, and 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools were identified for clinical training. Nine additional gamified, virtual environment training tools not commercially available were also identified. Conclusion: Many published studies suggest possible benefits from using gamified media in medical curriculum. This is a rapidly growing field. More research is required to rigorously evaluate the specific educational benefits of these interventions. This archive of hyperlinked tools can be used as a resource for all levels of medical trainees, providers, and educators. \textcopyright{} 2016 American Osteopathic Association.},

  abstract = {The use of videogames in healthcare interventions is gaining popularity, but there is still a gap in the understanding on how these types of interventions are used for the management of diabetes. The purpose of this review is to examine published research on the use of videogames for diabetes management. With the increased use of mobile technology, the review was expanded to understand whether games, gamification, and virtual environments can be used for diabetes self-management. Out of the 307 articles identified, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria of the study. The duration of most studies was short, with small sample sizes. All interventions targeted behavioral changes examining risk reduction of diabetes-related risk and promotion of healthy behavior among study participants. Videogames appeared to be helpful tools for education in some interventions, whereas gamification and virtual environments increased extrinsic motivation and provided positive reinforcement. This review concludes by discussing the potential of using videogames and gamification for the self-management of diabetes. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

  title = {Gamification as an Educational Technology Tool in Engaging and Motivating Students; {{An}} Analyses Review},
  volume = {21},
  issn = {19366612},
  abstract = {The use of educational technology has been improving in schools since the turn of the century. The current educational curriculum has been revamped to incorporate information, communications and technology (ICT). The immersion has either been a stand-alone subject or infused into elements of other subjects, most prominently in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In some educational technology research, it has shown that infusion of technology has shown contrasting results when it came to teaching and learning. Although, there have also been studies that shown improvement in motivation of the students in this technology laced classrooms, yet it did not lead to a better cognitive understanding. Furthermore with the problems such as difficulty in accessing to technology, teacher misconception about technology usage in classroom, student disengagement towards learning in classroom, we could not see the full extent of the educational technology capability. And so this spawns for the introduction of games as an educational tool; as it is related with enjoyment and is far off from its relation to work. With the infusion of technology, it has produced off shoots such as game based learning, serious games and more recently gamification. As gamification refers to the inclusion of `gamefulness' to existing systems as opposed to creating an entirely new game; thus paves the way for easier implementation as an educational tool. Therefore this paper will discuss about the role of gamification as an educational technology tool in engaging and motivating students; based on analyses review of several literatures. \textcopyright{} 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

  abstract = {This chapter presents an overview of gamification in the domain of market research, with a specific focus on digital data collection methods, such as online surveys. The problems faced by the market research industry are outlined, followed by a discussion of why gamification has been offered as a possible way to overcome some of these challenges. The literature on gamification is reviewed, with a focus on results from empirical studies investigating the impact of gamification on outcome variables such as data quality and respondent engagement. Finally, the authors present results from an original study conducted in 2013, comparing differences between a conventional (text-dominant) survey and a gamified version of the same survey. \textcopyright{} 2016, IGI Global.

  title = {A Descriptive Literature Review and Classification Framework for {{Gamification}} in Information Systems},
  volume = {2015-May},
  abstract = {Gamification evolved to one of the most important trends in technology and therefore gains more and more practical and scientific notice. Yet academia lacks a comprehensive overview of research, even though a review of prior, relevant literature is essential for advancing knowledge in a field. Therefore a novel classification framework for Gamification in Information Systems with the intention to provide a structured, summarized as well as organized overview was constructed to close this gap of research. A literature review on Gamification in quality outlets combined with a Grounded Theory approach served as a starting point. As a result this paper provides a foundation for current and future research to advance the knowledge on Gamification. Moreover it offers a structure for Gamification research which was not available previously. Findings from the literature review were mapped to the classification framework and analyzed. Derived from the classification framework and its outcome future research outlets were identified.},

  abstract = {Games and game elements are increasingly used by organizations to facilitate learning and motivation, often without a clear understanding how they actually achieve these effects. This may lead to the insufficient design and use of serious games as well as gamified applications. Since the development of such applications is usually expensive, high costs and few realized benefits might result. In order to avoid such unfavorable outcomes, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to learning and motivation. For this purpose, this study reviews research articles describing the use of games and game elements beyond entertainment and outlines their theoretical foundations. Based on the resulting insights, several theory-driven design guidelines for game-based learning and motivation are derived. This study therefore equips researchers with theoretical insights on how games and game elements facilitate learning and motivation, and practitioners with theory-driven design guidelines for their design and evaluation.},

  title = {Gamification-{{A}} Novel Phenomenon or a New Wrapping for Existing Concepts?},
  abstract = {Adding game elements to products and services has become a popular approach for enhancing users' experiences. Accordingly, gamification is widely considered an important method for intrinsically motivating users toward a preferred behavior. But what exactly about gamification is actually novel? In a broad literature review, we compare and contrast gamification to similar concepts such as hedonic, persuasive and intrinsically motivating information systems. By decomposing and classifying game elements found in the literature, we distinguish between already existing elements and ones that can be considered new. In order to drive this area of research forward, we develop an extended framework for gamification, identify gaps in the literature, and propose future avenues for research.},

  abstract = {Overall, this chapter offers a critical perspective on gamification in education and defines gamification as purposeful experiences that utilize game design and game elements. First it focuses on the basics of learning. Second it explores the advantages and disadvantages of technology in relation to teaching and learning, as many technologies share similar traits. Third it examines how technology has influenced education (i.e., reform) in the past, and offers insight on the impact games may have on education. Fourth it reviews gaming research and what it means to student learning with respect to both current and past research trends. Last, it contends that using a scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) framework can help create a more evidence based approach to the use of gamification in education. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {The popularity of computer science education triggered a dramatic rise in the number of tertiary institutions offering computer science courses. Nevertheless, many employers complain that graduates do not have the required skills. Lately, the higher education sector has faced a continuous decrease in the number of students choosing to study computer science courses, and some of the reasons for this rejection are related to the difficulties in mastering computer science skills. As core subjects in a computer science major, programming language subjects play an important role in successful tertiary computer science education. The embedding of gamification in programming courses has been identified as a potential technique that could maximize student participation and have a positive impact on learning. This research aims to provide an overview of how the embedding of gamification in online collaborative learning can enhance participation among novice programming students. The main findings from this review include the identification of the important participation elements for programming students in the online collaborative learning environment, a list of game elements embedded in online collaborative learning to facilitate participation among programming students, and suggestions regarding suitable gamification approaches for programming courses.},

  abstract = {The application of game elements within learning environments takes many forms, including serious games, interactive virtual environments, and the application of game mechanics within non-gaming contexts. Given the breadth of strategies for implementation game-elements into instructional systems, it is important to recognize that each strategy carries its own potential benefits and risks. The purpose of the current paper is to review the relevant interdisciplinary literature regarding the application of games and game-elements to learning contexts, and identify the factors to consider when developing a game-inspired instructional system. Secondly, the current discussion considers the special case of game technology and game design elements in intelligent tutoring, and identifies future research opportunities to meaningfully integrate such features in adaptive tutoring systems. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {In the academic debate on smart city definition, the ``human'' part of the city is gaining a prominent position as a decisive factor in good city policies. So, Public Administrations (PAs) are looking for the citizen involvement in the decision-making processes, in order to create products and services really meeting the city needs. In this context, gamification principles are more and more employed as facilitator of the citizen engagement process. In this paper, we intend to show the main findings of our analysis on the literary review about application of gamification principles in the smart city context, providing some considerations about their possible application in public policies co-design. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {The use of gamification for directing and motivating customers' behaviour and supporting crowdsourcing practices in marketing is increasingly spreading. This chapter reviews the literature for identifying the game principles and elements that can lead to effective gamification, and it then demonstrates the applicability and implications of this theory by discussing various gamification applications developed for supporting crowdsourcing marketing practices in tourism.The examples demonstrate that gamification can be used for crowdsourcing any marketing practice and influencing customer behaviour at any stage of the consumer behaviour process. Implications for future research are also provided. \textcopyright{} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract = {This paper will review the literature on gamification and aim to apply principles of analysis for synthesize existing research, identify issues of controversy, uncover areas that future gamification research should investigate. The paper starts with an introductory paragraph which gives an overview of the topic (i.e., define the concept, identify the characteristic components, discuss about the elements of a gamified experience). Then, the attention is focused on gamified learning, in order to investigate what happens when gamification is introduced in class, especially on student's motivation, engagement, and performances. The last part focuses on the lines of research to be pursued in the area of gamification and suggestions are made regarding those aspects which would benefit most from future research. \textcopyright{} 2015, Italian e-Learning Association.

  abstract = {Tourism is perceived as an appropriate solution for pursuing sustainable economic growth due to its main characteristics. In the context of sustainable tourism, gamification can act as an interface between tourists (clients), organisations (companies, NGOs, public institutions) and community, an interface built in a responsible and ethical way. The main objective of this study is to identify gamification techniques and applications used by organisations in the hospitality and tourism industry to improve their sustainable activities. The first part of the paper examines the relationship between gamification and sustainability, highlighting the links between these two concepts. The second part identifies success stories of gamification applied in hospitality and tourism and reviews gamification benefits by analysing the relationship between tourism organisations and three main tourism stakeholders: tourists, tourism employees and local community. The analysis is made in connection with the main pillars of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. This study is positioning the role of gamification in the tourism and hospitality industry and further, into the larger context of sustainable development. \textcopyright{} 2015 by the authors.},

  abstract = {While gamification is gaining ground in business, marketing, corporate management, and wellness initiatives, its application in education is still an emerging trend. This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.},

  abstract = {The incorporation of game mechanics and dynamics in non-gaming applications is a subject of interest in various sectors such as education, marketing, medicine and military, in the last few years. It is believed that engineering education in a pre-graduate level and in professional practice will bring high pay-offs. The role of the academia is to develop new methodologies and tools to produce, apply and use digital games and gamification techniques in contemporary industry and present scientific evidence on the value and the benefits derived from this technology. In this paper, the relative literature is evaluated and a discussion on the gamification status today is given, by examining various aspects of this novel term. Furthermore, game techniques, gamification practices in education and e-learning are considered. Special discussion on engineering games, gamification platforms and empirical surveys is presented with focus on manufacturing. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement, motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more attractive. Much research work has studied the application of gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and results of developers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the organization, and replicability. Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements, project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management, maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings. The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  volume = {22},
  issn = {14604582},
  abstract = {Effective chronic disease management is essential to improve positive health outcomes, and incentive strategies are useful in promoting self-care with longevity. Gamification, applied with mHealth (mobile health) applications, has the potential to better facilitate patient self-management. This review article addresses a knowledge gap around the effective use of gamification design principles, or mechanics, in developing mHealth applications. Badges, leaderboards, points and levels, challenges and quests, social engagement loops, and onboarding are mechanics that comprise gamification. These mechanics are defined and explained from a design and development perspective. Health and fitness applications with gamification mechanics include: bant which uses points, levels, and social engagement, mySugr which uses challenges and quests, RunKeeper which uses leaderboards as well as social engagement loops and onboarding, Fitocracy which uses badges, and Mango Health, which uses points and levels. Specific design considerations are explored, an example of the efficacy of a gamified mHealth implementation in facilitating improved self-management is provided, limitations to this work are discussed, a link between the principles of gaming and gamification in health and wellness technologies is provided, and suggestions for future work are made. We conclude that gamification could be leveraged in developing applications with the potential to better facilitate self-management in persons with chronic conditions. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s).},

  volume = {8518 LNCS},
  issn = {03029743},
  abstract = {Gamification is an approach which seeks to positively impact diverse wellness and health-related contexts, not only because it can get people more engaged and make them more responsible for their health-related decisions, but also because it can enhance the performance of healthcare workers. It, therefore, affects both the costs of personal wellness and the healthcare. Gamification is an informal umbrella term for the use of video game elements in non-gaming systems that aim to improve user experience and user engagement. The current paper's focus is to introduce theoretical aspects of gamification and its potential impact on health-related contexts, as well as present the state-of-the-art on how gamification is being employed in such contexts. Examples from contexts such as exercise, nutrition, weight control, medication adherence, and hands' hygiene, among others, are included. Finally, the challenges inherent to the design of successful gamification strategies and approaches are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The term "gamification" is generally used to denote the application of game mechanisms in non-gaming environments with the aim of enhancing the processes enacted and the experience of those involved. In recent years, gamification has become a catchword throughout the fields of education and training, thanks to its perceived potential to make learning more motivating and engaging. This paper is an attempt to shed light on the emergence and consolidation of gamification in education/training. It reports the results of a literature review that collected and analysed around 120 papers on the topic published between 2011 and 2014. These originate from different countries and deal with gamification both in training contexts and in formal educational, from primary school to higher education. The collected papers were analysed and classified according to various criteria, including target population, type of research (theoretical vs experimental), kind of educational contents delivered, and the tools deployed. The results that emerge from this study point to the increasing popularity of gamification techniques applied in a wide range of educational settings. At the same time, it appears that over the last few years the concept of gamification has become more clearly defined in the minds of researchers and practitioners. Indeed, until fairly recently the term was used by many to denote the adoption of game artefacts (especially digital ones) as educational tools for learning a specific subject such as algebra. In other words, it was used as a synonym of Game Based Learning (GBL) rather than to identify an educational strategy informing the overall learning process, which is treated globally as a game or competition. However, this terminological confusion appears only in a few isolated cases in this literature review, suggesting that a certain level of taxonomic and epistemological convergence is underway. \textcopyright{} The Authors, 2014.},

  abstract = {"Gamification" is a concept which aims to increase user experience and engagement with a system, while education is an area with high prospective for application of this concept. A lot of research is ongoing since it seeks to improve the quality of learning of students. Current situation on research of "Gamification in education" is still at initial stages where all of them aim to improve the effectiveness of education activity using game elements. Several gaps on the studiesdone on gamification in education have been identified. In this paper, we seek to answer the following questions; "how can we make education more interesting?" and "what is the role of gamification in adult learning process?" by method of literature review. \textcopyright{} 2014 Garamkhand Surendeleg, Violet Murwa, Han-Kyung Yun and Yoon Sang Kim.},

  abstract = {Trying to take advantage of the growing passion for games, Gamification is a trending phenomenon that aims at motivating people by applying elements common to games in different contexts. While first applications of Gamification exist in finance, health, education and entertainment, utility of Gamification in various contexts has not been sufficiently explored. Aiming to understand how Gamification can be applied to information systems to increase end-user motivation, we performed a systematic literature review to identify game elements used in Gamification. Our study yields a synthesis of mechanics and dynamics in five clusters - system design, challenges, rewards, social influences and user specifics. While our study reveals that Gamification has potential for motivating information system end-users, we also discuss the potential risks. Future research should analyse concrete implementations of Gamification in information systems contexts and investigate related long-term effects. From a practical perspective, we present Gamification as an innovative approach to enhancing end-user motivation to utilise information systems and illustrate the various options that can be applied to design Gamification applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the use of gameful design in the automotive domain. Outside of vehicles the automotive industry is mainly using gameful design for marketing and brand forming. For in-vehicle applications and for applications directly connected to real vehicles, the main usage scenarios of gameful design are navigation, eco-driving and driving safety. The objective of this review is to answer the following questions: (1) What elements of gameful design are currently used in the automotive industry? (2) What other automotive applications could be realized or enhanced by applying gameful design? (3) What are the challenges and limitations of gameful design in this domain especially for in-vehicle applications? The review concludes that the use of gameful design for in-vehicle applications seems to be promising. However, gamified applications related to the serious task of driving require thought-out rules and extensive testing in order to achieve the desired goal. \textcopyright{} 2013 ACM.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the use of gamification in social science research as a means of designing more effective research studies. The theory of gamification is particularly relevant to market research because surveys straddle the dividing line between work and fun. Completing a survey is, in most cases, a voluntary task done for altruistic reasons. How questions are designed has a powerful impact on making surveys more fun and game-like. Survey technology somewhat limits designers' creativity, but the following fundamentals are essential namely use more imagery, challenge the layout and design rules, and get rid of the grid lines. The gamification of research gives rise to three common questions: Who responds to gamification techniques? What impact does gamification have on the data? How do these techniques work in different cultures? \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Gamification - the use of game design elements in non-game contexts - is touted by many as the solution of how to make applications and processes more engaging to people that may have little or no motivation to engage with them otherwise. Based upon a literature review, the paper argues for guidelines concerning two aspects of gamifying an activity: ensuring that a continued focus on the main activities can be preserved and considering designing for playfulness. Furthermore, the relation between gamification and play is discussed, and some possible issues with gamification are presented. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

  title = {Systematic Literature Review: {{An}} Exploration of Gamification in the Context of Engineering Education},
  abstract = {Gamification - the application of game design elements to real-world situations not commonly associated with games - is quickly expanding in the world of education. With excellent potential to engage students, gamification has achieved a strong footing in K-12 research, due largely to the grassroots efforts of non-profit organizations and public school teachers who advocate it in classroom design. However, little effort exists to explore the implications of gamification within the realm of higher education - and especially engineering education - whose potential benefits from gamification meet or exceed those of the K-12 system. By synthesizing literature within engineering education and gamification, this paper analyzes the state of the literature and explores the fit of gamification to learning in the engineering context. To this end, two facets of gamification are defined and explored: Motivational Gamification, where game elements meant to motivate particular behaviors are applied to classroom design, and Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL), where video games themselves are used as learning tools. A case is developed to highlight key areas of research in contemporary engineering education, such as the development of complex problem-solving skills, and identify areas where gamification is being applied to these dilemmas. Future areas of research are also proposed.},

  abstract = {This paper, published in large part in Ciaramitaro's (2011) Virtual Worlds and E-Commerce, reflects how gaming and virtual worlds have impacted on ecommerce in recent years. A dynamic commercial environment with massive growth in user numbers and an overspill into real worlds through gamification, virtual worlds have contributed new language, new ways of engaging customers in branded virtual experiences and new business models. Co-creation and co-production remain central themes within this environment. Convergence between online and offline proceeds apace, facilitated by ever more accessible technological interfaces such as mobile and tablets but also now micro-projection technologies that enable new ways of sharing and engaging. The paper reviews the convergence context and concludes with a discussion of how relationships between customers and businesses have changed, economies have emerged and boundaries between virtual and real have become blurred to form gamified commercial experiences.
