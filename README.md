### Tools for the data extraction process

1. Install zotero desktop ([https://www.zotero.org/download/](https://www.zotero.org/download/))
2. Install better-bibtex plugin into zotero ([http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/](http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/))
3. Install zotfile plugin into zotero ([http://zotfile.com/](http://zotfile.com/))


### Data extraction process using zotero

To participate in the data extraction process register as member of the group "systematic_literature_review_of_gamification" in the website of zotero through the URL: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/2366342/systematic_literature_review_of_gamification](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2366342/systematic_literature_review_of_gamification)

1. Open the PDF file attached to the item of zotero in the group library using your favorite PDF editor (e.g. Acrobat PDF reader, PDF Foxit, Master PDF)

![Open PDF file](figs/01screenshot.png)

2. Annotate the data on the PDF file using the highlight and sticky note tools of the PDF editor as shown on the Figure below - the labels used to annotate the data are detailed on the tables of section "**Data to be extracted (data extraction form)**".

If some data won't be found in the paper, don't worry. It means that these data were not published by the authors in the review. 

3. Use the extraction tool of zotfile plugin to automatically extract the annotations as shown on Figures below.

![Extract annotation from PDF file - part b](figs/03screenshotb.png)

4. Conver each annotation into a note. Encode each note using the text "[Label]: ..." at the begin of the notes as shown in the Figures below for the data: "Context".

#### Data to be extracted (data extraction form)

In general from the Abstract and Introduction section, the following data may be extracted:

| Label | Description |
|--------|----------|
| Review type | Type of literature review. Some possible values are: systematic liverature review, systematic literature mapping, meta-analysis, bibliometric analysis. (as was explicitly indicated by the author - plz, dont use your own criteria) |
| RO(_n_) | Review objective. For the 1st review objective use the label: RO(1). For the 2nd review use the label: RO(2), ... In general, you can found the review objectives described in the abstract or introduction section with phrases such as "this review aims to ....". |
| Context | Context in which the gamification is framed for the review. For example, "software enginnering education" when the literature review is something like "gamification on software enginnering education." |
| Number of selected studies | The number of selected studies after the selection process. The number of studies used in the literature review to answer the research questions. |
| Period (selected studies) | The range of years for the selected studies |

In general from the Method section, the following data may be extracted:

| Label | Description |
|--------|----------|
| Databases | Databases in which the search string is applied to find the primary studies |
| Search string | Search string used to find the primary studies. Format the search string using AND and OR operators |
| Search strategy | Search strategy used by the authors to find the studies in the databases (As was explicitly indicated by the authors in the paper) |
| Exclusion criteria | List of exclusion criteria as was explicitly indicated by the paper's authors |
| Inclusion criteria | List of inclusion criteria as was explicitly indicated by the paper's authors |
| Selection procedure | Selection procedure of studies as was explicitly indicated by the paper's authors |
| Quality assessment criteria | Criteria for quality assessment as was explicitly indicated by the authors in the article |
| Quality assessment procedure | Quality assessment procedure as was explicitly indicated by the authors in the article |
| Preventive steps to minimize bias and errors in the quality assessment | Steps taken to avoid bias in the quality assessemnt as was explicitly indicate by the author in the paper (frequently indicated in the "Limitation" or "Validity Evaluation") |
| Data extraction form | Form used during the data extraction process as was explicitly indicated by the authors in the review (mention only the fields and reference to this form) |
| Data extraction process | Data extraction procedure as was explicitly indicated in the review |
| Preventive steps to minimize bias and errors in the data extraction process | Steps taken to avoid bias in the Data extraction process as was explicitly indicate by the author in the paper (frequently indicated in the "Limitation" or "Validity Evaluation") |


In general from the Results and Discussion sections, the following data may be extracted:
 
| Label | Description |
|--------|----------|
| RQ(_n_) | Research question. For the 1st research question, you should use "RQ(1)." For the 2nd research question, you should use RQ(2) ... . If research questions are not explicitly indicated by the authors but they are inferred from the results indicated in the section "results" or "discussion", you should use (inferred) at the end of the research question in the note. |
| Answer to RQ(_n_) | Answer to the research question. To indicate the answer for the 1st research question, you should use "Answer to RQ(1)." To indicate the answer for the 2nd research question, you should use "Answer to RQ(2)" ...  |
| Method of data synthesis to answer RQ(_n_) | Method used to synthesis data and answer the research question. Some examples of data sysnthesis are: narrative texts, tabular, bar charts, bubble chart,... |
| Method of presenting details (about selected studies) to answer RQ(_n_) | Method to present the details bout each selected study in reference to the research question _n_. Some examples of method frequently used to present details are: use of tabular data, narrative texts. |

From the Discussion and Conclusion sections, the following data may be extracted:  

| Label | Description |
|--------|----------|
| Flaw on the gamification research | Flaw  and gaps about gamification research indicated by the authors reviews |
| Practitioner guideline | Some literature review at the discussion and conclusions indicated guidelines to practitioner about gamification based on the evidences found in the selected studies. Such as, "based on ...., we suggest that educators/designers/developers should be .... " | 
| Research agenda | Some literature reviews indicate a research questions or issues that the authors suggest to explore in a near future |
