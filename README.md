## Validation of extracted data using zotero

To validate the extracted data, You only as _second reviewer_ need to open the PDF-file of the article, and to validate the annotations making by the _main reviewer_ (_reviewer assigned to the data extraction_). If you notice troubles or you have suggestions, you should create a new note that begins with the text "Validation:" as shown in the figures below.


![Conver the annotation into notes](figs/04screenshot.png)
![Note of Validation](figs/05screenshot.png)

After the validation, the _main reviewer_ can solve the troubles and/or accept the suggestion pointed by the _second reviewer_.
If there is a disagreement between the _main reviewer_ and _second reviewer_, a _third reviewer_ will be assigned to solve the disagreement at the end of the data extraction process.


# Data analysis phase

The data analysis is carried out through quantitative and qualitative methods. These methods are:

* [Method: Classification schemes (qualitative method)](#method-classification-schemes-qualitative-method)

## Method: Classification schemes (qualitative method)

A classification scheme is used to group the extracted data based on the common characteristics of them. Therefore, the tool mindomo is used for this purpose.

* Tool: Mindomo ([https://www.mindomo.com](https://www.mindomo.com))
 
Some information may fall in more than one category. Therefore, when the data extracted fall in more than one category, an icon is used to indicate the number of categories in which this data fall. As example, in the figure below, we shows that the information "Gamification for waste management and gamification for schoolchildren" extracted from the litetarture review "A review of the applicability of gamification and game-based learning to improve household-level waste management practices among schoolchildrens" fall in the two categories: (1) "education", and (2) "environment and society".

![example-fall-in-two-categories01](figs/06screenshot.png)
![example-fall-in-two-categories01](figs/07screenshot.png)

We built the following classification schemes: 

1. Classification of literature reviews by type
  * Purpose: Identify the types of review on gamification.
  * URL: [https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/classification-by-review-types-c5761495660e44f78c98868ea16e087f](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/classification-by-review-types-c5761495660e44f78c98868ea16e087f)
  * Responsable researcher to classify: geiser@usp.br 
  * Responsable researcher to validate: diego.matos@famed.ufal.br
  * The classification of reviews by types follows the characteristics indicated in the table.

  | Review type | Description |
  |-------------|-------------|
  | Structured Narrative Review | Close similar to a traditional review because may have bies. Its extraction processes may be unclear, may not include qualitative analysis or not use classification as methods of data synthesis (such as voting, counting or other) |
  | Descriptive or Mapping Review | Review that includes clear selection and data extraction process. A qualitative assessment is not carried out, and the data analysis is based on the interpretation of each selected study as a unit in the whole  published literature | 
  | Scoping Review | Review that includes clear selection and data extraction process. Close similar to structure narrative review or descriptive/mapping review, but it includes gray literature. |
  | Critical Review | A review that includes evaluation and an interpretive analysis of existing literature on a particular topic of interest to reveal strengths, weaknesses, contradictions, controversies, inconsistencies, and/or other important issues with respect to theories, hypotheses, research methods and/or empirical results. |
  | Realistic Review | Review based on a theoretical model/framework in which the data is structured according to this framework/model to find out whether, where and how it is applicable. |
  | Systematic Review | Review with qualitative assessment to synthetize and analyze the extracted data from primary studies. |
  | Meta-analysis | In adittion to a qualitative assessment of primary studies, a meta-analysis includes statistical analysis on effect sizes to combine the results of independent studies, and to find significant differences. |
  
2. Classification of literature reviews by contexts
  * Purpose: Identify the contexts in which gamification was framed for the literature review.
  * URL: [https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/classification-of-reviews-by-context-fe0a4a1a13a6493eb46d1d4b407794f2](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/classification-of-reviews-by-context-fe0a4a1a13a6493eb46d1d4b407794f2)
  * Responsable researcher to classify: geiser@usp.br
  * Responsable researcher to validate: diego.matos@famed.ufal.br
  * The contexts in which the reviews are classified follows the next scheme:
    - Health (E.g. gamification in health)
    - Education (E.g. gamification in higher education)
    - Environment and Society (E.g. gamification to promote waste recycling)
    - Business, Marketing, Enterprise and Services
      * Software Engineering (E.g. gamification in software engineering)
      * Crowsourcing (E.g. gamification in crowsourcing)
      * Information Systems (E.g. gamification in information systems)
    - Without context (E.g. gamification per-se, gamification frameworks)


4. Classification of research questions used on the gamification research:
  * Purpose: Identify the research questions explored by the literature reviews on gamification.
  * URL: [https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/a64d340f6f504397bd68afb61b0d3297](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/a64d340f6f504397bd68afb61b0d3297)
  * Responsable researcher to classify: geiser@usp.br
  * Responsable researcher to validate: leonardo.marques@cedu.ufal.br
  * The major groups for the classification of RQs are:
    - RQs about the game-related approaches
    - RQs about the gamification-based design
    - RQs about the adaptive gamification
    - RQs about the gamification analytics
    - RQs about the gamification models/frameworks
    - RQs about the publication information on gamification
    - RQs not related to gamification or game-related approaches (RQs related to the non-game contexts)


3. Classification of review objectives on gamification research:
  * Purpose: Identify the review objectives explored by the literature reviews on gamification.
  * URL: [https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/fcb801a4b2d64d4ab0014f667783fa58](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/fcb801a4b2d64d4ab0014f667783fa58)
