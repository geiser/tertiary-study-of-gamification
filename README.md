# tertiary-study-of-gamification


### Tools for the data extraction process

1. Install zotero (https://www.zotero.org/)
2. Install better-bibtex plugin into zotero (http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
3. Install zotfile plugin into zotero (http://zotfile.com/)


### Data extraction process using zotero

To participate in the data extraction process register as member of the group "systematic_literature_review_of_gamification" in the website of zotero through the URL: https://www.zotero.org/groups/2366342/systematic_literature_review_of_gamification

1. Open the PDF file attached to the item of zotero in the group library using your favorite PDF editor (e.g. Acrobat PDF reader, PDF Foxit, Master PDF)

![Open PDF file](figs/01screenshot.png)

2. Annotate the data on the PDF file using the highlight and sticky note tools of the PDF editor as shown on the Figure below - the labels used to annotate the data are detailed on the tables of section "**Data to be extracted (data extraction form)**".

If some data won't be found in the paper, don't worry. It means that these data were not published by the authors in the review. 

3. Use the extraction tool of zotfile plugin to automatically extract the annotations as shown on Figures below.

4. Conver each annotation into a note. Encode each note using the text "[Label]: ..." at the begin of the notes as shown in the Figures below for the data: "Context" and "Period (selected studies)"
