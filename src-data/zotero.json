      "abstractNote": "To ensure proper competence development and short graduation times for engineering students, it is essential that the study motivation is encouraged by new learning methods. In game-based learning, the learner's engagement is increased and learning is made meaningful by applying game-like features such as competition and rewarding through virtual promotions or achievement badges. In this paper, the state of the art of game-based learning in building services engineering education at university level is reviewed and discussed. A systematic literature review indicates that educational games have been reported in the field of related disciplines, such as mechanical and civil engineering. The development of system-level educational games that realistically simulate work life in building services engineering is still in its infancy. Novel rewarding practices and more comprehensive approaches entailing the state-of-the-art information tools such as building information modelling, geographic information systems, building management systems and augmented reality are needed in the future. © 2015 SEFI.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents an overview of gamification research. It introduces a panoramic research map that comprises a research map and keyword maps for each year of publication of research on gamification. The panoramic research map resulted in a detailed view of gamification research: covered areas, types of published papers, gaps, and most researched themes. The main area of research on gamification is related to the education and training domain, showing a strong connection to the use of game design elements and game experience to improve educational scenarios among students. Knowing the panoramic research map aids the development of future research on gamification, helping in the identification of important papers, gaps in the knowledge, and relevant papers for future research. As an additional outcome, the panoramic research map might also be used to understand other fields of research or specific themes besides gamification. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1): Six years of formal research on gamification led to eight main domains of research, as listed: education, training, and academia (44.38%, n = 162); business, marketing, enterprise, and services (15.34%, n = 56); general (11.23%, n = 41); health and lifestyle (8.77%, n = 32); urban, transportation, social, and political (4.93%, n = 18); information science, communication, computation, and internet (4.38%, n = 16); engineering, development, and technology (2.74%, n = 10); and research methods (2.74%, n = 10)</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=6\">note on p.196</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(2): the most cited game element, according to our findings, is the point (29%), followed by level, rewards, and progress (13%) (Fig. 5). The less used of the game elements listed by the authors is the status. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=9\">note on p.199</a>)</p>\n<p>The biggest variance was in the use of points, showing a difference of 17% between 2014 (23%) and 2017 (40%). The lower variance was in the use of badges, that showed a difference of only 5% between 2015 (12%) and 2016 (7%) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=9\">note on p.199</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Data extraction process: \"Fig. 1 Method to develop a panoramic research map\" summarizes the method to develop a panoramic research map in which also the data extraction procedure is detailed as follows (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=5\">note on p.195</a>).</p>\n<p>The research map was created using the year of publication as concentric circles: from the oldest publication in the center of the chart (2012) to the newest in the border (2017). Domains were represented as the slices of the pie chart, ordered by their frequency. Each paper is represented by a single number, a specific shape, and color.</p>\n<p>In section \"Data extraction procedure\", the data extraction process is described as follows (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=5\">note on p.195</a>).</p>\n<p>Summary maps were created by identifying the most common words used by authors to describe the research in the abstracts. Words were normalized to allow frequency analysis. Variant words were considered as a single one: as an example, the variant words \"gamification\", \"gamify\", and \"gamified\" became \"gamification\". We have eliminated words that could not add to the analysis, such as \"no\", \"the\", and \"we\", as well as terms such as \"provide\" and \"paper\", that were meaningless terms as single words. Normalized words were classified into five groups: domain, activity, process, outcome, and player. The domain group includes words related to the area where gamification was applied or studied. Activity words include actions and activities performed during gamification or to gamify. Process words comprise those words related to tools and elements used to gamify. Outcome words are focused on the desired results of the gamification process. Words from the player group include those concerning people who will use or benefit from gamification. The top 150 most-used words were analyzed and combined into the summary map. The map illustrates concentric circles representing years, and pieces (pie slices) representing groups. Evolution maps use the same list of normalized words from the summary maps. This map allows the identification of the most-used keywords on a temporal line, enabling a comparison between words across years.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=6\">note on p.196</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Search strategy: We have searched for the string gamif* to cover gamifcation related words such as gamifed, gamifying, and others. As gamifcation is applied to diverse domains, we have selected three multidisciplinary databases to conduct the research, performed on July 14th, 2017: EBSCOHost, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. No flters regarding the year of publication have been chosen, while we fltered document type to show only the following types of works: articles, book chapters, books, editorials, and reviews. As the last flter, we narrowed the search to show papers that had the word “gamifcation” as a keyword. This way we could both focus on the main related gamifcation studies and pass over most of the briefy related research. After searching the databases using the stated flters, we have found 815 papers, including duplicates, as shown below in Table 1.

        "<p>Selection process: Section 2.2. Classification indicated the selection process.</p>\n<p>According to this section, the studies were classifed according to their research type, research domain, year of publication, and listed keywords. Three types of research were identifed: empirical, theoretical, and practical. Empirical, or application, papers present ways gamifcation is used. Theoretical papers include literature reviews, defnitions, and other discussions mainly based on theoretical aspects. Practical papers present surveys, models, frameworks, and related Contributions that help in developing, applying, evaluating, or understanding gamifcation. Some papers have characteristics of more than one group, and we have included them in a single group according to the major outcome of the research. In example, Lopez and Tucker (2017) present a method to evaluate the complexity of implementing a game feature and its impact on increasing motivation.</p>\n<p>The paper was classifed as a practical research, as its main outcome is the method that was developed.</p>\n<p>A case study is also presented, but the research was not included as an empirical paper, as gamifcation was only applied on a case study to evaluate the use of the method. Titles, abstracts, highlights, and keywords were used to classify the papers. The same method of classifcation presented above was used to classify all the researches. We have faced a problem described by Seaborn and Fels (2015): a large number of false positives, where the term “gamifcation” is used to describe other domains besides gamifcation. As Seaborn and Fels (2015) noted, we understand that gamifcation does not comprehend a fully developed game—the focus is on its elements. Thus, we have excluded papers where the authors stated that a game was developed. Besides the mentioned focus, exclusion criteria have also been included: papers that had a weak relation to gamifcation (for example: gamifcation is presented as a future research opportunity and just briefy discussed); papers we were unable to access; and those that do not provide enough or clear information in the abstract to classify the research paper. After eliminating papers using the described criteria, the classifcation phase ended with a list of 365 individual records (Table 2). The complete list of all papers can be seen in an appendix of the ESM provided as a complementary material.<br />(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BZAQ76XI?page=4\">note on p.194</a>)</p>",

A total of seventeen relevant studies were identified that had been implemented across a range of disciplinary areas in the period under review (2005–2015). The results indicate that online gamified/games-based learning has been shown to increase the level of academic performance of learners, and improve cognitive competencies in problem-solving, multiplicative reasoning ability, self-efficacy and critical thinking. Learners’ intrinsic motivation has been shown to have been enhanced through motivational factors (confidence, satisfaction and enjoyment) promoted within the online game design, and this had a direct effect on increasing engagement and improving academic achievement. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(2): the factors contributing to the successful implementation of game-based learning/gami ed learning in enhancing young learners ' dispositions include: motivational gaming features, social interaction (collaboration), immersive gaming environments, enjoyment elements, and some gami cation elements (such as: feedback, leaderboards, and badges). Furthermore, the application of constructivist principles in game-design, inclusion of opportunities for social interaction (collaborative, cooperative) and integration of competitive features within game design have been shown to have positive impacts on learners ' cognitive abilities and academic performance.</p>\n<p>Studies have also highlighted factors reducing levels of learners ' engagement and motivation, and thus impact negatively on learners ' dispositions, within games-based/gami ed learning contexts. These include games with low levels of challenge and, conversely, games that promote competition between players, which have been shown to result in decreased levels of motivation, engagement or interest in disciplinary area; thus, impacting learners ' dispositions. Interestingly, studies of games-based learning with too high a degree of challenge have also been shown to decrease learner interest and to negatively impact on their cognitive abilities and academic performance.

        "<p>Data extraction process: The selected papers were initially coded according to whether an increase, decrease or no change was recorded in the dispositions, abilities and/or behaviours of learners. The age-group, disciplinary area and size of study were also recorded. In addition, factors that contributed to changes in dispositions, abilities and/or behaviours of learners were noted. The outcomes from the coding process were then cross-tabulated to ascertain common outcomes and corresponding themes, and these were then presented within the frame of discussion under the headings of 'Dispositions ' , ' Abilities ' and ' Behaviours ' in game-based/gamified learning contexts.

The following search results were obtained: Science Direct (590 papers), IEEE (107 papers) and Springer (395 papers) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3NSNGUZL?page=2\">note on p.2</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: In section \"2.Methodology,\" it is detailed as follows:</p>\n<p>Studies were selected with the following inclusion criteria; (1) have been published from 2005 to 2015, (2) have focused on primary education aged 6–12, (3) have been written in English language. It also should be noted that only those games employing an Internet or Wifi connection were considered ‘online’, and, consequently, papers presenting research on topics, such as digital based-learning without use of internet connection, were not included in this review.<br /><br />Given the permeation of broadband/wifi and mobile technologies, this study took a particular focus on games being used for learning purposes that were accessible online through commonly used mobile devices with wifi connection (laptop and or tablet technologies) and desktop computers with an Internet connection within classrooms or at home. Console games were thus excluded, as they are not commonly integrated within classrooms, as console games are often beyond budgetary constraints of many school systems – we do recognize that there are some notable exceptions to this such as Learning and Teaching Scotland’s exploration and promotion of consoles in Scottish classrooms from 2006 onwards. Furthermore, there was emerging anecdotal evidence at the time of this review of games traditionally accessed via consoles being translated for use via PCs and/or mobile devices (the launch of Microsoft Educational Version of Minecraft in 2016 which is accessible by PC and Mobile phone is evidence of one such recent translation). Furthermore, this study was particularly interested in online games being used by the 6 to 12 year old age group. As such, the research terms used narrowed the search field to include games employing an Internet or Wifi connection for 6–12 year olds, while excluding console games. In total over 1000 papers were isolated using the initial search terms, and following a manual reading and review of each of these, only 17 studies were found to have met the criteria as outlined above for this meta-analysis, as explained below.

Gamification in software engineering (SE) education is in its infancy. However, as SE educators we are particularly interested in understanding how gamification is pollinating our field and the extent to which the above claim is valid in our context. A systematic literature mapping has underscored the difficulty in fully corroborating the above claim because few empirical data are available so far. However, key trends and challenges have been identified. We found that the purpose of applying gamification in the SE field is mostly directly related to improving student engagement and, to a lesser extent, to improving student knowledge, although other targets are the application of SE best practices and socialization. We have also discussed insightful issues regarding the implementation cost of gamification, patterns in the most often used gamification elements, and the SE processes and teaching activities addressed. Of the identified challenges, we should highlight the complexity of deciding which gamification approach to follow, the lack of information for choosing gamification elements and the need to control the impact of gamification. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

The key fields are: <br /><br />* Research Type: The following classifications were adapted from (Petersen and Feldt, 2008) and (Wieringa et al., 2006) to the education field in order to record the type of research reported in the primary studies:<br />- Evaluation research: A study reporting gamification applied in a SE course, where evaluation is conducted in a real setting (i.e., classroom).<br />- Validation research: A study reporting gamification applied in a SE course where the gamified solution was validated in a laboratory setting (e.g., a pilot study, experiment with volunteer students).<br />- Solution proposal: A study proposing a gamified solution for a SE course that was neither evaluated in a real setting nor validated in a laboratory environment.<br />- Experience paper: A study reporting the authors‟ experience, reflections, benefits and drawbacks of gamifying SE education.<br />- Philosophical papers: A study describing a new conceptual idea, implying a new way of  gamifying SE education. - Opinion paper: A study reporting the authors‟ opinion about applying gamification in SE education rather than describing a new result of applying gamification in SE education, a novel design, or a conceptual idea.<br />* Type of SE course in which gamification was applied, that is, whether the gamified SE course was a traditional course with no online support, an online course, a blended learning course, or other. <br />* Gamified educational activity, that is, the type of educational activity, such as projects, assignments, lectures, etc. that has been gamified.<br />* SE processes, categorized according to the ISO/IEC 12207 classification for software life-cycle processes: software design, software process, software requirements, software testing, software risk, software integration, software construction, software implementation, software verification, software validation, software metrics, software maintenance, software configuration, project planning, project assessment.<br />* Gamification approach, recording the different methods and approaches, if any, followed to gamify a SE course. We defined a gamification approach as the series of steps or actions taken in order to gamify a SE curriculum or course. <br />* Gamification elements, recording the gamification dynamics, mechanics, and elements used in primary studies as part of the gamified SE curriculum or course. <br />* Type of implementation, recording the supporting tools or platforms, if any, that were developed or used as part of the gamified experience.<br />* Purpose of applying gamification, recording information about the aim or reason behind gamifying a SE course, that is, do the authors want to improve student performance, motivation, etc.<br />* Gamification impact, gathering information regarding the evidenced effect of applying gamification in SE education.</p>\n<p>After re-reading the full text of the primary studies, we captured text segments from the original papers and reasoned some other important details into the data extraction process. By “reasoned”, we mean that the answer to some research questions may not be a straightforward piece of text. In these cases, we had to summarize some information from the context. For example, the gamification elements used in primary studies are generally a straightforward piece of information. On the other hand, we very often had to understand and summarize different parts of the paper to extract and outline the gamification approach followed, as this was not as straightforward as highlighting a piece of text.

        "<p>Practitioner guideline:</p>\n<p>Some studies indicated negative results in which gamified solution was not gradually incorporated to the curriculum or slowly introduced to the students. We take the view that this could have led to an extra cognitive workload for the students. This may have caused a sense of confusion or frustration which prevented them from fully understanding and enjoying the “game”. Buisman and van Eekelen (2014) describe this idea as “high-intensity gamification”; where new processes and activities are created as part of the <br />new gamified experience. On the contrary, a “low-intensity gamification” approach introduces gamification gradually starting with no new activities and merely integrating gamification elements into existing processes. Besides, the introduction of gamification as a separate learning approach, when gamification is all about \"integration in\" or \"combination with\" the learning/teaching process, would just increment the noise in the learning process. Students would get distracted by new rules, new elements, new ways of learning, blurring the learning experience as a whole. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=27\">note on p.157</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Practitioner guideline: The introduction of gamification elements require a major effort on the part of educators to adapt the materials and the course workflow, even in the case of what some authors term low-intensity gamification, so as not to alter and disturb the students' learning process (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=29\">note on p.159</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Preventive steps to minimize bias and errors in the data extraction process: It is detailed in the section \"3.6. Validity Evaluation\" as follows.<br /><br />Data Extraction. This threat refers to the likelihood of authors extracting and interpreting data differently. Again researcher bias is a possible threat to the data extraction process. To reduce this threat, the designed data extraction form included a clear definition of each data field, which the authors discussed to assure a common understanding. Additionally, the data extraction process was performed by the first author and then reviewed and validated by the second author. The review process consisted of either adding or correcting specific contents in the data form, or adding comments regarding the clarity of the extracted data. This review process was highly beneficial in terms of extracting implicit data, and it provided a better understanding and representation of the extracted data.

        "<p>Search strategy: In Section \"3.2. Search Process\", the search strategy is described as the process summarized in Figure 1 and described as follows.</p>\n<p>The search process followed in this study is outlined in Figure 1 and was conducted during the first half of 2017. The search string was composed of three major terms: gamification, software engineering, and education. Each term was then refined into multiple synonymous terms.</p>\n<p>For the term “gamification”, we, like other literature reviews on gamification (Hamari, Koivisto and Sarsa, 2014; Pedreira et al., 2015) considered the keywords: gamifying, gamified, gamify, and gamification. Other terms like “gameful” and “funware” were not added to the search string because they introduced many irrelevant search results, especially in the field of serious games and game-based learning, which are outside the scope of this study. As for the term “software engineering”, we adopted the approach outlined by Pedreira et al. (2015) and used the keywords shown in Figure 1 in accordance with the software processes defined in ISO/IEC 12207.</p>\n<p>For the third part of the search string, Figure 1 shows the synonyms used for “education”, which are consistent with other systematic mapping studies in education such as (Qadir and Usman, 2011) or (Marques, Quispe and Ochoa, 2014).</p>\n<p>Finally, the search terms were then linked using the logical operator “AND” for the three major parts of the search string and “OR” for synonymous keywords.</p>\n<p>We selected IEEE, ACM, SCOPUS, Web of Science (core collection), Web of Science (Inspec), and ScienceDirect as our primary sources based on the recommendation of Petersen, Vakkalanka and Kuzniarz (2015) and the search string was applied on meta data. To remove duplicates and manage search results, we used the Mendeley reference management tool (Mendeley, 2017).</p>\n<p>Table 2 shows the search results per database. We also applied backward snowballing in the search for primary studies, that is, we tracked and scanned the references of papers marked as potentially relevant in search of other relevant studies. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=7\">note on p.137</a>)</p>\n<p>Summary of Search strategy (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=9\">note on p.139</a>)</p>\n<p>To reduce threat related to the completeness of the search process, we took different actions. First, we designed a search string that was as comprehensive as possible, while limiting the keywords to the scope of the study. To identify the synonyms of the major search terms, we referred to previous mapping studies within the field of SE, gamification, and education. Then, we applied the search string on several different scientific databases and indices to make sure that the coverage was exhaustive. On the other hand, this mapping study only included papers whose authors use the concept of gamification in terms of using game elements for non-game contexts, in this case SE education. This decision was helpful for excluding papers dealing with game-based learning or serious games, which are outside the scope of this study. However, we might have missed some papers that use game-based-learning or similar terminology to refer to gamification ideas. All systematic mappings about gamification that we have found in literature are open to this threat; it would have been extremely costly to check all papers under the game concept.

        "<p>Selection process: The selection process is detailed in the section 3.3. as follows.</p>\n<p>Selection process: <br />The selection process of primary studies was composed of two screening stages. During the first stage, the titles and abstract were read to measure relevance. During the second stage, the full text was read to make a decision on inclusion or exclusion. To avoid the premature exclusion of studies, doubtful studies were always included for further and detailed reading during the second stage. In general, we are interested in studies that gamify SE education. More specifically, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined: <br /><br />Inclusion criteria:<br />1. Studies dealing with gamification AND<br />2. Studies dealing with SE education.<br />Exclusion criteria:<br />1. Studies gamifying SE rather than SE education, or studies gamifying courses not related to ISO SE processes.<br />2. Studies dealing with serious games or game based learning or not explicitly using gamification<br />(see section 2.1, for the definitions of these terms).<br />3. Studies whose full-text is not accessible.<br />4. Studies not written in English.<br />5. Studies that are summaries of other studies.<br />6. Panel studies or summaries of conferences.</p>\n<p><br />In the first stage, the first author scanned a total of 127 studies retrieved by the database search process (after removing duplicates). As a result, 40 papers were marked as potentially relevant based on reading titles and abstracts. The second author screened all the potentially relevant studies and initially agreed on 93% of the studies (37 papers). A discussion regarding the other three papers led to the decision to <br />include all of them for a thorough full-text reading in stage two. Furthermore, the second author reviewed a random selection of 30% of the 87 excluded papers from stage one to confirm that both researchers had interpreted the exclusion criteria consistently and prevent potentially relevant papers from being left out. <br /><br />The second stage involved both authors applying the selection criteria after reading the full text of the papers selected in Stage 1. This stage also included the backward snowballing process after tracking the references of the 40 papers from Stage 1. As a result, a total of 21 papers (see Appendix A) were included, 19 papers from the database search and two papers from backward snowballing. To increase the reliability of the Stage 2, the authors discussed each of the 42 papers (40 from Stage 1 plus 2 from the <br />snowballing process) and together decided to include the 21 papers. During both stages, we recorded the rationale for excluded papers, as shown in Table 3. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=12\">note on p.142</a>)</p>\n<p>Summary of selection procedure (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=10\">note on p.140</a>)</p>\n<p>To deal with the threat of study selection that concerns to the possibility of researcher bias and author disagreement on exclusion and inclusion, we applied two strategies to deal with this threat. First, both authors defined clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, which they discussed to reach a common understanding of each criterion. This method reduced the threat of author disagreement as they had a coherent list of criteria to refer to in the event of discrepancy. Since the study selection process was primarily performed by the first author, there was a threat of researcher bias. Hence, the second strategy for dealing with threats with respect to the study selection process was to have the second author review the selection process. Therefore, the second author randomly selected and checked 30% of the excluded studies to assess the validity of the first author‟s decisions.<br />(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G6JL59YI?page=13\">note on p.143</a>)</p>\n<p> </p>",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification illustrates motivation and encouragement that can be gained by people during using gamified experience. Gamification technology has been successfully applied in several domains including health and fitness, marketing, daily activities and education. It is the strategy which uses heterogeneous game elements within nonentertainment context. As Millennial Generation students have their own needs and preferences, the necessity of having personalized learning is increased recently to boost the effectiveness of the education system. Thus, many researches have investigated how dissimilarities between students can influence their suitable game elements. Since 2010 the published studies on gamification area increased; moreover, some attempts have been made to study the personalization in the gamification model. In this paper, we conducted a review of personalization in gamified learning experience to answer two review questions. We collect, review and synthesize studies related to gamified learning and personalization published from 2010 to 2017. The review strategy included six stages to identify the articles. 13 studies were identified which discussed adopting personalization and gamified learning experience in education. The results show that the studies that apply personalization within gamified learning approach accelerated during the last 3 years. This review reveals the trends in personalization parameters used in the studies, such as student's learning style and personality type. Moreover, most studies have shown high student performance while using the personalized gamified learning experience. © 2018 IEEE.",

        "<p>Search strategy: In subsection \"D. Primary search process\", it is detailed as follows.<br /><br />The researchers have not used specific journals for the searching phase; instead, they considered several online databases as the main sources for the academic articles. Scopus, ACM Digital, IEEE Explorer Library, ScienceDirect, Springer, Google scholar, and Web of Science are the online databases that were used. These databases provide high impact factor publications. An automatic search can be carried out through keywords. Therefore, in order to perform the search process, the research questions of this review acted as a guide in the keywords identification. The keywords were “gamification\"; “gamified learning”; and “personalized learning”. Furthermore, manual searching was conducted by reading the title, abstract and introduction to ensure the relevancy of the selected studies. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5ER7LP4D?page=3\">note on p.63</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Search string: gamification, \"gamified learning\", \"personalized learning\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5ER7LP4D?page=3\">note on p.63</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Selection procedure: In section \"C. Exclusion and inclusion criteria\", the selection procedure of primary studies is detailed.</p>\n<p>Having inclusion and exclusion criteria assists the researchers in choosing the studies which are appropriate and related to the review topic. Table I shows the exclusion and Inclusion criteria of this review. Since gamified learning and personalization are the main review topics, the selection of the articles required consideration of some inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles from journals and conferences written in English language between 2010 and 2017 were the target of this current research.</p>\n<p>The motive for deciding on this period is that gamification was coined in 2010 as a technology of engaging and motivating people to increasingly interact with non-entertainment activities. Therefore, since then, many researchers have investigated some aspects such as students' performance, engagement, game elements perception, differences. Moreover, some articles discussed the personalized and gamified learning through several techniques. The number of articles before conducting the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 18. However, the final number of articles after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria becomes 13 articles from journal, conference and symposium.

      "abstractNote": "The popularity of computer science education triggered a dramatic rise in the number of tertiary institutions offering computer science courses. Nevertheless, many employers complain that graduates do not have the required skills. Lately, the higher education sector has faced a continuous decrease in the number of students choosing to study computer science courses, and some of the reasons for this rejection are related to the difficulties in mastering computer science skills. As core subjects in a computer science major, programming language subjects play an important role in successful tertiary computer science education. The embedding of gamification in programming courses has been identified as a potential technique that could maximize student participation and have a positive impact on learning. This research aims to provide an overview of how the embedding of gamification in online collaborative learning can enhance participation among novice programming students. The main findings from this review include the identification of the important participation elements for programming students in the online collaborative learning environment, a list of game elements embedded in online collaborative learning to facilitate participation among programming students, and suggestions regarding suitable gamification approaches for programming courses.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1): Gamification has been successfully applied in small to medium scale projects, mostly in different functional areas. As a result, there is an insufficient evidence to conclude the presence of a comprehensive framework applicable to all domains (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N255VU3D?page=6\">note on p.6</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(2): According to the studies, the concept of Gamification began its evolution mainly in 2010, while the first Framework proposal was not only done till 2012. Meantime, the concept remained purely theoretical or experimental without much thought of modeling. During 2012 and 2013, the number of proposed frameworks remained relatively low and stable, but revived only after 2014, with an incremental evolution of the patterns according to priority (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N255VU3D?page=4\">note on p.4</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(3): Motivation, engagement, game element and process are at the top of the charts, with a presence in almost all the frameworks (more than 50 articles). Second, the patterns related to the objectives, improvement and Gamification Meaningful have a high frequency ranging from 40 to 50 items. However, a weak presence of sustainability, balancing and security patterns is noticed (less than 20). The rest of the patterns represents an average frequency (between 20 and 40), specifically: Design Model, Metrics, profiling, User-centred and Prototype (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N255VU3D?page=4\">note on p.4</a>)</p>",

Following this trend, it is possible to find an increasing number of publications studying these subjects. With this meta-analysis we synthesise and integrate all the earlier literature and information available on gamification and serious games, assessing the current state-of-the-art in the field, filling a literature gap on this subject. We calculated meta-analysis effects from a total of 54 studies and 59 datasets collected from the literature. Attitude, enjoyment, and usefulness are the most relevant predictors of intention to use gamification. Intention, enjoyment, and usefulness are the most relevant predictors of the brand attitude towards gamification. Our results allow us to present a theoretical model that will be of value to future gamification studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

        "<p>Search strategy: It is describe in part of section \"2.

We started identifying and searching in the most known electronic scientific databases available, namely ACM, IEEE, Science Direct, Scopus, Emerald, Springer, ISI Web of Science, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Google Scholar. We searched these relevant sources continuously for gamification and interrelated keywords such as serious games, games for a purpose, productivity games, behavioural games, pervasive games, augmented reality games, as well as other grammatically equivalent terms such as gamified, gamify, gamifying, and gamif* (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/445I2S8W?page=2\">note on p.307</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: As part of Section \"2. Research methodology\", it is described as follows.<br /><br />Following a rigorous inclusion criteria, the search was further limited to: (i) studies published or available online within the period between January 2010 and the end of January 2018, (ii) journals, articles, reviews, conferences, and books, allowing us to exclude most non-scientific publications, (iii) quantitative studies with complete correlation values, removing qualitative works, reviews, conceptual studies, or works that did not present this type of quantitative statistical information, and (iv) independent datasets, removing articles using previous datasets already included, and avoiding biasing the study using the sample more than once (Wood, 2008). Besides studies already<br />published until the end of the literature review period, November 2017; we also included accepted papers in-press that had a publishing date until the end of January 2018 in our work.<br /><br />Conferences, theses, and books were included in our work to address high effect sizes bias commonly linked with journal articles (Pappas &amp; Williams, 2011). We did the same to the studies with multiple independent datasets (e.g. (Bourgonjon et al., 2013; Darban et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2016a; Sande et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017) each of them contributing with an additional dataset). The final result is a total of 54 papers and 59 datasets that meet the criteria, comprising 50 journal articles (92.6%), two conference papers (3.7%), one master dissertation (1.9%), and one book section (1.9%). This can be considered as a meta-analysis dimension comparable to other earlier studies published in top-tier Journals, such as Lamb et al. (2018), who included 46 studies, Wu &amp; Lederer (2009), with 52, and Baptista and Oliveira (2016), with 57 works.

This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.",

        "<p>Data extraction process: The section \"Categorization Criteria\" details this process as follows.</p>\n<p>In order to answer the research questions, we performed a concept-centric review focusing on categories related to the context of use and game elements employed for gamification of education. The review of the papers provided us with information allowing the classification of the current research and work in the field along the following dimensions: Game elements; Context: Type of application; Context: Education level; Context: Academic subject; Implementation; Reported results from evaluation.<br /><br />With regard to the categorization of the game elements, we first surveyed the existing seminal, conceptual and literature review publications on gamification (not included in the 34 papers reporting empirical research). However, we discovered that there is not a commonly agreed classification of game design elements. For example, the popular game element “badges” is considered as a game interface design pattern in (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, &amp; Nacke, 2011), a game mechanic in (Zichermann &amp; Cunningham, 2011), a game dynamic in (Iosup &amp; Epema, 2014), a motivational affordance in (Hamari, Koivisto, &amp; Sarsa, 2014), and a game component (a specific instantiation of mechanics or dynamics) in (Werbach &amp; Hunter, 2012). Nevertheless, all authors define the game design elements at several levels of abstraction. For example, Zichermann and Cunningham (2011), following traditional computer game theorists, categorize game elements into mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Mechanics define the way games (as systems) convert specific inputs into specific outputs. Dynamics guide how players and the game mechanics interact during the game. Aesthetics refer to the way the game mechanics and dynamics interact with the game designer’s artistry, to produce cultural and emotional outcomes. Differently, Deterding et al. (2011) categorize game design elements at five levels of abstraction. Ordered from concrete to abstract, these are: interface design patterns, game design patterns or game mechanics, design principles, heuristics or “lenses,” conceptual models of game design units, and game design methods and design processes. <br /><br />For the purpose of reviewing the use of game elements in gamified educational contexts, we use a two-level framework. The first level combines the first two levels of Deterding’s classification and as most of the authors we refer to it as game mechanics. We further combine Levels 3 and 4 of Deterding’s classification (game design principles and conceptual models) and call them educational gamification design principles. We use the term gamification design principles instead of game design principles to stress the fact that a number of these are not specific to games; in the education domain, some have been used in instructional systems as long as those have existed. These two categories roughly correspond to the first two components of the framework in (Zichermann &amp; <br />Cunningham, 2011). The last Deterding’s category “game design methods and processes,” as well as Zichermann’s “aesthetics,” are essential for the game elements’ implementation but not relevant to this mapping study.<br /><br />To further identify the second level of the classification structure, we collected game mechanics and game design dynamics, patterns, and principles used in the 34 reviewed case studies on using gamification in education. We identified the use of the following game mechanics: points, badges, levels, progress bars, leaderboards, virtual currency, and avatars. Point systems are managing the acquisition and spending of points that quantify user performance. Badges are given for special achievements. Based on the received points and badges the users are ranked on leaderboards which reflect their performance in comparison to other users. Levels show the user’s expertise and progress and where the player is in the game. Progress bars provide a percentage-based graphical representation of the players’ progress. Virtual currency is used for purchasing in-game (virtual) goods.<br /><br />Table 1 below presents the identified educational gamification design principles with, where appropriate, the game mechanics typically used to implement them. For each principle, corresponding references are presented. Some of the listed educational gamification design principles are fundamental and always present in educational systems, but may need to be adapted to fit the gamification paradigm. For example, the feedback should be immediate or with shorten cycles (not as in the current educational practices). Others have been used individually and sporadically by some instructors but still need re-thinking in the light of gamification, and some are new design elements borrowed from video games.

We also removed early papers that only explain the concept of gamification and suggest very general possible uses in education. Meanwhile, we investigated the references of the found papers and discovered several papers relevant for the review but not covered in the databases.

      "abstractNote": "Background Compared to traditional persuasive technology and health games, gamification is posited to offer several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being, and increasingly used. Yet little is known about its effectiveness. Aims We aimed to assess the amount and quality of empirical support for the advantages and effectiveness of gamification applied to health and well-being. Methods We identified seven potential advantages of gamification from existing research and conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies on gamification for health and well-being, assessing quality of evidence, effect type, and application domain. Results We identified 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and well-being. 59% reported positive, 41% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes. Conclusions The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. However several studies report mixed or neutral effect. Findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations of many studies (e.g., a lack of comparison of gamified interventions to non-gamified versions of the intervention). © 2016",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1):<br />- Quality of evidence were weak (n = 8), strong (n = 8), and moderate (n = 3) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3MICFNE?page=14\">note on p.102</a>)<br />- Impact of gamification was positive (59%) with mixed or neutral effects (41%). More specifically, a largely positive impact for behavior (13 positive, 6 mixed or neutral), and, with impacts for cognitive outcomes, reported as positive (n = 8) and mixed/neutral (n = 9) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3MICFNE?page=14\">note on p.102</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(2):<br />- Game design elements: rewards (16 studies), avatars (6 studies), leaderboars (6 studies), social interaction (5 studies), levels (4 studies), progress (3 studies), story/theme (3 studies), challenges (2 studies), feedback (1 study) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3MICFNE?page=13\">note on p.101</a>)<br />- As delivery platform: mobile devices (n = 7) , and websites (n = 6)<br />- few studies (n=8) discuss motivational theory, and very few (n=3) assessed the motivational constructor and positive outcomes based on them. 5 studies was related to SDT theory, 1 study was related to reduce attrition and the guides for behavior change, 1 study was related to empowerment, and 1 study was related to the trans-theoretical model of behavior change.

        "<p>Answer to RQ(3):<br />- audience: kindergarten age (n=2) to adolescents (n=1), the majority of studies were conducted with adults (n= 13). By specific audiences, primary school teachers (n=1) participants with chronic back pain (n=1), rheumatoid arthritis (n=1), or high-levels of trait anxiety (n=1)<br />- studies involved participants with motivation (n = 11), participants without  motivations (n = 8), and the majority of without motivation (n = 7) showed positive results<br />- Positive impacts for: young children around eating behaviours (n=2); university students regarding alcohol consumption (n=1)</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3MICFNE?page=15\">note on p.103</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(4): the most popular and successful context was physical health (n = 13), and more specifically, its use for motivating individuals to increase their physical activity, or to engage in self-monitoring of fitness levels (n=10). Notably, with a positive impact of gamification on physical activity were observed in 8/10 studies with mixed effects observed in 2/10 studies.

        "<p>Quality assessment procedure: In section \"2.4. Quality assessment tool\", this procedure is detailed as follows.<br /><br />We used the quality assessment method presented by Connolly et al. (2012). The tool was explicitly developed to assess the strength of evidence of a total body of work relative to a particular review question. Connolly et al. (2012) used the tool to assess the overall weight of empirical evidence for positive impact and outcomes of games. We applied the tool to our more focused interest in the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification in the health and wellbeing domain. Each final paper included in the review was read and given a score of 1–3 (where 3 denotes high, 2 denotes medium and 1 denotes low on that criterion) across the following five criteria:<br />1) How appropriate is the research design for addressing the research questions of this review (higher weighting for inclusion of a control group). a. High — 3 RCT. b. Medium — 2, quasi-experimental controlled study. c. Low — 1, case study, single subject experimental, pre-test/post-test design<br />2) How appropriate are the methods and analysis?<br />3) How generalizable are the findings of this study to the target population with respect to the size and representativeness of the sample?.<br />To what extent would the findings be relevant across age groups, gender, ethnicity, etc.<br />4) How relevant is the particular focus of the study (incl. Conceptual focus, context, sample and measure) for addressing the question of this review?<br />5) To what extent can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question?<br /><br />The total weight of evidence for each paper is calculated by adding the scores of all five dimensions, with a range from 5 to 15. Connolly et al.'s (2012 p. 665) analysis of the empirical evidence regarding games and serious games found a mean rating of 8.56 and a mode of 9, which gave us a baseline to evaluate gamification studies against. Connolly et al. (ibid.) found 70 of 129 or 54% of studies to be above the mode, constituting “stronger evidence”. We elected to categorise in slightly more detail, with papers with a rating 8 or below categorised as “weaker evidence”, papers with a rating above 8 to 12 as “moderate evidence”, and papers with a rating above 12 as “stronger evidence</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q3MICFNE?page=4\">note on p.92</a>)</p>",

      "abstractNote": "The term \"gamification\" is generally used to denote the application of game mechanisms in non-gaming environments with the aim of enhancing the processes enacted and the experience of those involved. In recent years, gamification has become a catchword throughout the fields of education and training, thanks to its perceived potential to make learning more motivating and engaging. This paper is an attempt to shed light on the emergence and consolidation of gamification in education/training. It reports the results of a literature review that collected and analysed around 120 papers on the topic published between 2011 and 2014. These originate from different countries and deal with gamification both in training contexts and in formal educational, from primary school to higher education. The collected papers were analysed and classified according to various criteria, including target population, type of research (theoretical vs experimental), kind of educational contents delivered, and the tools deployed. The results that emerge from this study point to the increasing popularity of gamification techniques applied in a wide range of educational settings. At the same time, it appears that over the last few years the concept of gamification has become more clearly defined in the minds of researchers and practitioners. Indeed, until fairly recently the term was used by many to denote the adoption of game artefacts (especially digital ones) as educational tools for learning a specific subject such as algebra. In other words, it was used as a synonym of Game Based Learning (GBL) rather than to identify an educational strategy informing the overall learning process, which is treated globally as a game or competition. However, this terminological confusion appears only in a few isolated cases in this literature review, suggesting that a certain level of taxonomic and epistemological convergence is underway. © The Authors, 2014.",

        "<p>Search strategy: In section \"2. Process and sources,\" it is detailed as follows.<br /><br />Scoping – culminated in definition of (a) the search string to be adopted, namely: &lt;gamif*&gt; (gamification, gamify, gamified, etc.) AND ; (b) the latitude of the search (full‐text); and (c) the time span of interest, i.e. scientific works published between 2000 and early 2014. To maximise coverage in the search step, channels of three different types were targeted: the Web (via the Google Scholar search engine), indexed databases of scientific publications (Web of Knowledge, Scopus), and also academia‐driven social networks (ResearchGate, Academia.org). When this first search was executed, a huge number of results was retrieved, almost three thousand deriving from Google Scholar alone. The need thus arose to reappraise the scope and search string in order to obtain a more selective, focused and usable data set. Accordingly, the latitude was adjusted, with gamif* applied strictly to the publication title field, rather than to full‐text. This meant that the papers selected for analysis would be those dealing with gamification as a core research concern, as opposed to those that simply mention the topic in passing for some reason. Table 1 below shows the number of records matching the above criteria that were retrieved from each of the adopted sources.

      "abstractNote": "Adaptive gamification is an emerging and fast-growing research stream, that enhances traditional gamification approaches with user-centered, personalized and adaptive incentive mechanisms, tailored to a specific characteristic of different users and contexts. While game-like elements have been successfully applied to increase end-user engagement, satisfaction and task performance in different domains, the effectiveness has often been mixed, highly context specific and varied among individuals. In order to understand how adaptive gamification approaches can be developed that overcome such problems, we have conducted a systematic literature review that identifies main issues and challenges in current literature on adaptive gamification. The analysis corpus is composed of 43 identified studies and includes supporting theoretical contributions from related research areas. The performed analysis provides several contributions. First, a conceptual matrix of adaptive gamification design is proposed that identifies major dimensions of current approaches and classifies these accordingly. Second, we came up with a thematic overview where the identified literature and their related studies are assigned to the designated areas. Finally, we identify five research challenges and propose a research agenda that can serve as a basis for future research directions and for practitioners who want to apply adaptive gamification strategies in real-world applications. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

        "<p>Search strategy: The set of described keywords has been applied to the (1) Article (2) Title (3) Abstract and (4) Keywords in the databases listed in table 2. Not all of them support the same functions of applying a search query to specific fields (e.g. WebOfScience, Proquest).

        "<p>Selection process:<br />The inclusion criteria have been defined as follows: (1) The paper is  about the design or application of gamification in a way that considers user-centered, personalized or contextual criteria towards an adaptive approach for gamification optimization, (2) the paper is written in English, (3) the paper has a minimum of four pages (4), the paper is not a duplicate, (5) the paper adheres common scientific standards.</p>\n<p>The exclusion criteria do not accept research regarding serious games, as the use of a full-game environment where users play (Deterding et al., 2011) does not fit to the research objectives of this review, although a clear line between gamification and serious games is often missing and poorly distinguished in the literature (Monterrat, 2015a). Darejeh and Salim (2016) argue that both these concepts use game mechanics and elements in serious contexts, but they are fundamentally different, as gamification is the process of adding game mechanics to existing entities so that they are more engaging, pleasurable and do not make use of a virtual game environment where users control a character or an object. Book reviews, editorials, keynotes, panel talks or conference reviews (scopus document type) were not considered in this review, as well as papers with a publication date after September 2016. The aim of this review is to gain a broad overview of relevant IS literature, therefore the search is not limited to highly ranked journals, which also seems inappropriate due to the novelty of gamification research. In general, studies on human-computer interaction have the tendency to publish to conferences first (Seaborn and Fels, 2015), which explains why the vast majority of papers are conference papers. For the identification of relevant articles, a systematic scientific search has been applied to the databases listed in Table 2, which yielded a total number of 1370 papers. After analysing the results and going through each step of the review process, we came up with a final decision and declared 43 papers (Table 2) as relevant sources. To the best of our knowledge, all those papers meet the inclusion  criteria and contribute to the emerging research stream of adaptive gamification.

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is an innovative approach that aims to increase users' engagement and motivation and provide sustainable experiences. It has recently become widely known and is an approach that is being used in many fields. This article intends to identify and map trends and patterns in gamification research. For this purpose, this article employs a systematic review in which document and content analysis were used. Research findings have revealed that conceptual/descriptive papers outweigh other type of papers; however, quantitative and qualitative papers are showing an increasing trend. Lexical analysis demonstrated that education, teaching, and learning; engagement, motivation, and behavior change, and gamified designs, are emerging concepts. Keyword analysis revealed that gamification, engagement, and motivation are most frequently used keywords. Gamification articles are mostly related to the education field. Self-Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetic) Framework appeared to be the most beneficial lenses in gamification studies. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.",

        "<p>Data extraction process: The section \"Reliability\" details the method to avoid bias in the extraction process.<br /><br />In the first phase, articles that were included in the research corpus were coded according to preset categories. After completing the coding process, another researcher recoded the same articles in the second phase. Following these phases, the results were compared and categories that were different from each other were examined again. The categories that did not match were defined according to examination in the third phase and these categories were only coded when the researchers arrived at a consensus. In the fourth phase, an independent researcher who has experience in systematic reviews and gamification recoded research methodology, model and field categories, calculated inter-rater reliability. Inter-rater reliability of the final coding was found to be κ = .93. Altman (1991) proposed that Cohen’s kappa values from 0.81 to 1.00 qualify as very good; thus, the reliability of the study is considered as very good.

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, gamification, the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, has found widespread adoption in online-communities and social media applications with the aim to enhance brand awareness and loyalty, innovation, and online user engagement. Information Systems (IS) research seems to have just started to pay attention to gamification as a phenomenon that is worth to be studied, although the interaction of technological and social systems is at the core of the discipline. By means of a thorough literature review, we investigate whether gamification is actually a new phenomenon in IS research or if it has already been researched previously, but simply using a terminology that is different from current gamification research in other disciplines. Through this study, we identify the overlap between IS and gamification research, identify specific research needs, and suggest avenues for future research on gamification from an IS perspective. © Jan Broer and Jens Poeppelbuss. 2013.",

        "<p>RQ(1): Is actually gamification a new topic within IS research or if it has already been researched in IS, but simply using a terminology that is different from that in other research communities? (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/PDB6L8NP?page=1\">note on p.1</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Search strategy: In the section \"Literature Search,\" the search strategy is detailed as follows.<br /><br />In order to examine the use of gamification-like concepts in IS literature, we performed an exhaustive search in the Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals (EJIS, ISJ, ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, MISQ) through EBSCOhost and Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge, as well as the major conferences (ACIS, AMCIS, ECIS, ICIS, MCIS, PACIS) hosted by the Association for Information Systems through the AIS Electronic library. As our first step, we conducted an initial search for \"gamification\" in the titles and abstracts of papers within these sources that yielded very few results at the time of this writing. On the other hand, a search for simple related terms (such as \"game\", \"engagement\", or \"incentive\") led to thousands of hits, almost all of which seemed irrelevant to the topic. We therefore decided to focus our literature search and analysis on concepts that reflect the means and ends of gamification - as described above - from which we expected that they have already been subject to IS research in the past: Ends: user satisfaction, user experience, engagement, flow, motivation, learning, adoption; Means: gam*, scor*, incentive*, reward*, playful. In order to achieve a manageable set of hits with a high probability of relevance, we searched for combinations of terms from the two lists of concepts. Each term in the list of ends above was combined with each term in list of means through the use of an AND operator (e.g., user satisfaction AND gam*, user satisfaction AND scor* etc.). These term pairs were then combined with OR operators, meaning that any combination of terms points to a potentially relevant paper. The search, which we conducted in March 2013, resulted in a list of 174 papers. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/PDB6L8NP?page=4\">note on p.4</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: These papers were then screened for relevance by the two authors of this manuscript. Each one individually rated the papers as relevant or non relevant pertaining the use of gamification in IS research. We decided about a paper's relevance based on abstract and title where possible, in cases where the abstract did not provide enough information, the full text was accessed. We concurred on 85% of the screened papers and conferred on the remaining 26 papers with disagreements regarding their relevance, eventually including 19 of them in the final literature analysis. In addition, we eliminated those papers that only contained an abstract (e.g., poster presentations on conferences). The screening process resulted in a total set of 53 papers to be reviewed, about 30% of the original set. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/PDB6L8NP?page=4\">note on p.4</a>)</p>",

      "abstractNote": "Adding game elements to products and services has become a popular approach for enhancing users' experiences. Accordingly, gamification is widely considered an important method for intrinsically motivating users toward a preferred behavior. But what exactly about gamification is actually novel? In a broad literature review, we compare and contrast gamification to similar concepts such as hedonic, persuasive and intrinsically motivating information systems. By decomposing and classifying game elements found in the literature, we distinguish between already existing elements and ones that can be considered new. In order to drive this area of research forward, we develop an extended framework for gamification, identify gaps in the literature, and propose future avenues for research.",

      "abstractNote": "The increase in people’s life expectancy, with the consequent projection of 1 billion elderly people in less than 10 years and of 2 billion people in 2050 –22% of the global population–, makes it necessary to develop assistive technologies that contribute to the permanence and the protagonism of the elderly in their social context. In parallel, it is observed that smartphones have brought an increase in the use of applications by the elderly. Considering this segment of users, it was verified the need to identify accessible applications focused on cognitive memory training, due to: (1) the progressive increase in the number of elderly people in the Brazilian population; (2) the decline of the cognitive functioning resulting from the natural process of aging; and (3) the lack of accessible and dynamic applications focused on cognitive training. In order to provide greater user engagement while performing tasks and to make the user experience more enjoyable, engaging and challenging, gamification has been employed in the design and development of applications. Based on this scenario, we sought to identify the main ideas regarding accessibility and gamification applied to cognitive training and the memory improvement of elderlies. For that, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, originated from the following question: “How to create an accessible gamified application for cognitive memory training of the elderly?”. The state of the art and the few previous studies revealed the importance of researches on this subject. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

      "abstractNote": "Context: Testing is a fundamental activity in the software development cycle. Revealing software faults is its main objective. Despite that, testing is considered unpleasant, dull and tedious. As a result, there is a lack of expertise among professionals while many projects fail. Gamification is a promising way to address testing issues; it is a new trend being used mostly to increase motivation, engagement and performance with the use of game elements in non-game contexts. Objective: To describe results of a study that aimed to characterize how gamification has been explored to support software testing. Method: The studies that compose our baseline for analysis and discussion were obtained through a systematic mapping carried out following a research protocol. To retrieve relevant literature, we applied automatic search and backward snowballing. At the end, we selected 15 studies that we analyzed and classified according to six perspectives: application context, used gamification elements, gami-fication goals, testing techniques, testing levels, and testing process phases. Results: The most used gamification elements are points, leader boards, and levels, and unit testing and functional testing are the level and technique most addressed in the studies, respectively. Conclusion: Gamification is a rising research topic, especially in the software testing field. The increasing interest for gamification has the potential do lead to positive outcomes. The map presented in this paper can be a useful resource for the identification of gaps and for triggering new research initiatives. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper reviews peer-reviewed empirical studies on gamification. We create a framework for examining the effects of gamification by drawing from the definitions of gamification and the discussion on motivational affordances. The literature review covers results, independent variables (examined motivational affordances), dependent variables (examined psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification), the contexts of gamification, and types of studies performed on the gamified systems. The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "Application and gamification data contains valuable information about users and their behavior. This data can be used to measure the success of gamification projects, to analyze user behavior, and to continuously improve gamification designs. Existing software solutions promise support for analyzing game- and gamification-related data. However, research shows that most gamification projects do not monitor and analyze this data in an automated way, even though gamification experts are aware of its potential. In this survey paper we identify relevant software solutions and assesses them with regards to their fulfillment of user requirements in the gamification analytics domain. The survey results can be used by practitioners to make tool decisions. Furthermore, we identify gaps of current solutions that should be addressed by future work in the field of gamification analytics. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "In the last few years, gamification has been proven as an effective strategy to improve people's motivation and performance. Many authors have reported success examples of gamification in areas such as education, entertainment, health and business. This paper is focused on the use of gamification for health, specifically for the promotion of behavioral changes. Firstly, this paper describes a systematic review conducted to identify in the literature the gamification elements that are being used to promote behavioral change. The results of this systematic review evidence the broad terminology related to gamification elements, with different perspectives and levels of abstraction. Based on these results, a taxonomy for gamification mechanics has been proposed. The taxonomy identifies and classifies the most common gamification mechanics and relates them with psychological fundamentals on behavioral changes.",

      "abstractNote": "Energy consumption is a significant and critical social issue. Gamification and serious games offer a means of influencing people regarding energy consumption. A systematic review of articles (written in English) was conducted according to the specifications of the PRISMA checklist, in order to examine the literature and assess empirical support for the effectiveness of gamification and serious games in impacting domestic energy consumption. The search strategy included a combination of terms relating to gamification and serious games, and domestic energy consumption. Only primary studies reporting empirical data relating to the value of gamification and serious games on energy consumption were included. More comprehensive selection criteria were applied throughout the selection process (reported in full in the main text). Twenty-five primary studies published in 26 research articles were included in the final review. The findings indicate that gamification and serious games appear to be of value within the domain of energy consumption, conservation and efficiency, with varying degrees of evidence of positive influence found for behaviour, cognitions, knowledge and learning and the user experience. A common feature across many articles reviewed was the limited amount and quality of empirical evidence, which suggests that more rigorous follow-up studies are required to address this gap. The article makes specific recommendations to help address this challenge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

The majority of studies were based on a survey study design (n =11), followed by quasi-experimental study designs (n =5). Other study designs included case studies (n =2), pilot studies (n =2), and qualitative study designs (n =2). Only one longitudinal field study and one randomized control trial (RCT) were identified</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About study sample (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=4\">note on p.252</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a total of 4026 participants, however, many studies failed to report or did not clearly articulate participant numbers</li>\n<li>Sample sizes ranged from 5 (in a rapid usability assessment) to 2580 (in a survey to broadly characterise the target population), however, participant numbers were generally less than 200.</li>\n<li>The age of participants ranged from 6 years to 55 years. Participant characteristics were broad. The most widely represented group were young adults, with participants generally clustered between the ages of 18 and 30. This information is based on only half of the studies included in this review, as 13 of the studies failed to provide any information pertaining to the age of the participants in the study sample.</li>\n<li>The settings included household (n =7), laboratory (n =6), classroom (n =3), university dormitory (n =4), university campus (n =1), workplace (n =1) and in the participants ' private space (uncharacterised) (n =1). No information was provided regarding the setting for three of the studies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About data collection and analysis (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=5\">note on p.253</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most frequently employed method of data collection was the questionnaire, which was used to collect quantitative and/or qualitative data in 22 studies.</li>\n<li>For the collection of qualitative data, interviews were the most common data collection and analysis technique (n =13), followed by observations (n =4) and video recordings (n =2). Quantitative data was collected from energy meters or monitors (n =7), game server logs (n =7) and self-reported activity logs (n =2). Other methods included audio recordings, focus groups, user photographs (taken during an intervention), and various tools employed in the context of a usability testing protocol (including think-aloud verbal protocol, document analysis and task series).</li>\n<li>Data collection ranged from 3 weeks to over a year, with the majority extending for a period of between 1 and 4 months</li>\n<li>Data analysis was poorly reported by many of the eligible studies, with the majority failing to identify key aspects of the process and results (e.g., method of data analysis including techniques used to determine statistical significance was often not identified). Quantitative data analysis employed predominantly statistical methods (including significance testing (t-test), univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (MANOVA) testing, correlational analysis, Mann-Kendall testing, and descriptive statistics), while thematic analysis was the primary method of analysis for qualitative data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About the quality assessment (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=11\">note on p.259</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The quality of the studies ranged from 5 to 12. The mean rating for the 25 primary studies was 7.5, and the modal rating was 6. Papers rated 7.5 or over (above average) were considered to provide methodologically stronger evidence</li>\n<li>12 of 25 primary studies (48%) were assessed to be of higher quality (quality score of 7.5 or greater).

The other half (n =12) presented gami ed applications/tools [22,23,37 - 47]</li>\n<li>The majority of the games and gamified tools/applications (n =13) demonstrated a certain level of integration with the real world (category 2), followed closely by fully digital games with no real world integration (category 1) (n =12).

Within the behavioural category, the majority of studies (n=10) looked at real-world behaviour and a minority at in-game behaviour (n=3). It was common for multiple outcomes to be measured, with the majority of the studies eligible for review (n =17) measuring more than one outcome</li>\n<li>The impact of applied games on the user experience was consistently positive, the impact on in-game behaviours was consistently positive and the impact on real-word behaviours was almost always (90% of the time) positive and otherwise mixed/neutral. For cognitive and knowledge related outcomes the evidence is more mixed (though predominantly positive). For cognitive outcomes the majority (80%) of effects were positive with some (20%) evidence of mixed/neutral results. Finally, for knowledge related outcomes, although the majority (67%) of effects were positive, there was also evidence of a negative effect and some (22%) mixed/ neutral effects (11%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About the discipline in which the game/gamified tool/application were applied (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=12\">note on p.260</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most widely represented discipline was computer and information science (n =12), which included publications from a number of specialised interest areas including persuasive technology, informatics, gaming and human-computer interaction (HCI). The second most popular discipline was education, with seven studies examining the evidence from an educational perspective. Other disciplines represented included business and economics, energy efficiency, industrial design and engineering, behavioural sciences, communication studies, and community and regional planning, with one study published in each aforementioned area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About the reported effects (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=12\">note on p.260</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect of applied games on energy-related outcomes was largely positive, with exclusively positive effects demonstrated in 19 of the 25 studies.

        "<p>Search strategy: It is detailed in section \"2.4. Search\" as follows.<br /><br />Search terms included terms for gamification and serious games in conjunction with possible terms for energy-related outcomes. In order to capture all relevant studies according to the gamification and games criteria, search terms were selected to represent the variety of gaming formats that might emerge within the scope of applied games as per their definition in the present review. Terms relating to play were not included due to interest in the explicit use of applied games of some description. While it is recognised that this may exclude relevant studies where such terms are not used (e.g. playful, persuasive and pervasive applications), these were deemed to fall outside the scope of the current review.

        "<p>Selection procedure: In section \"2.5 Study selection\", the selection procedure is detailed as follows</p>\n<p>Study selection Papers identified by search terms in the initial database search were screened in two stages: first by title only, and second by both title and abstract. This was performed by a single researcher, with a small sample independently examined by a second researcher at each screening stage. Papers that progressed through the two stages of screening underwent a full-text assessment for eligibility. This was performed by a single researcher. Two additional researchers examined the results of the full-text eligibility assessment, to ensure compliance with the selection criteria. Following the full-text eligibility assessment, a total of n =26 papers representing 25 primary studies were found to be eligible for review</p>\n<p>2831 papers t the initial inquiry (see Fig. 1), which decreased to 2518 after duplicates were removed (n =313). A total of 2518 papers were screened by title, resulting in the removal of 2255 papers for a range of exclusionary factors, including incorrect publication type (n =152), published in a language other than English (n =17), and irrelevant overall based on title (n =2086). A total of 263 papers progressed to the second stage of screening, which involved application of the selection criteria to the title and abstract. A total of 191 papers were excluded as a result of the second stage of screening. The exclusionary factors for removal at this stage of screening were more detailed, with the breakdown as follows: incorrect publication type (n =18), theoretical / conceptual only (n =27), irrelevant outcome (n =23), examining applied games outside the energy consumption domain (n =47), examining energy consumption and/or efficiency but without incorporating applied games in the research (n =38), and irrelevant overall (n =38). A total of 72 papers remained to be assessed for eligibility based on their full-text. The eligibility assessment process resulted in the exclusion of 46 full-text papers for various exclusionary factors, including papers of a descriptive nature only (n =17), no specification of energy consumption and/or efficiency (n =11), no specification of gamification and/or games (n =5), examining energy consumption and/or eficiency within a context other than the household (n =5), mentioning gamification and/or games but not part of research (n =3), theoretical papers (n =3), reporting pre-testing data only (n =1), and repeat publications (n =1). A total of 26 papers representing 25 primary studies were deemed eligible for review and progressed to quality assessment (see Table 2 for details on all papers included in the full review). The results of one intervention was published across two separate research papers [22] and [23], and therefore considered to represent one primary study. Another two studies reported data from the same intervention, however, were considered to represent separate primary studies due to methodological differences [24,25]</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/G8TH79GQ?page=4\">note on p.252</a>)</p>",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a technique that reuses game design and elements in others contexts, such as in e-commerces systems and virtual learning environments. When applied in the educational area, the gamification purpose is to promote a better user experience by improving students' motivation and engagement. There are already several studies applying gamification in the educational systems, and many ways to evaluate its effects on students. Thus, the aim of this work is to investigate how these studies evaluate gamification and compare its usage in educational environments through a systematic mapping. From the 832 studies returned by the search engines, only 20 of them met the defined selection criteria. As a result, these studies compared and evaluated gamification through students' interaction, performance, and user experience, based on their activities and answers in satisfaction surveys and tests. © 2018 ACM.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification - the application of game design elements to real-world situations not commonly associated with games - is quickly expanding in the world of education. With excellent potential to engage students, gamification has achieved a strong footing in K-12 research, due largely to the grassroots efforts of non-profit organizations and public school teachers who advocate it in classroom design. However, little effort exists to explore the implications of gamification within the realm of higher education - and especially engineering education - whose potential benefits from gamification meet or exceed those of the K-12 system. By synthesizing literature within engineering education and gamification, this paper analyzes the state of the literature and explores the fit of gamification to learning in the engineering context. To this end, two facets of gamification are defined and explored: Motivational Gamification, where game elements meant to motivate particular behaviors are applied to classroom design, and Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL), where video games themselves are used as learning tools. A case is developed to highlight key areas of research in contemporary engineering education, such as the development of complex problem-solving skills, and identify areas where gamification is being applied to these dilemmas. Future areas of research are also proposed.",

      "abstractNote": "Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement, motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more attractive. Much research work has studied the application of gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and results of developers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the organization, and replicability. Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements, project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management, maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings. The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification has drawn the attention of academics, practitioners and business professionals in domains as diverse as education, information studies, human-computer interaction, and health. As yet, the term remains mired in diverse meanings and contradictory uses, while the concept faces division on its academic worth, underdeveloped theoretical foundations, and a dearth of standardized guidelines for application. Despite widespread commentary on its merits and shortcomings, little empirical work has sought to validate gamification as a meaningful concept and provide evidence of its effectiveness as a tool for motivating and engaging users in non-entertainment contexts. Moreover, no work to date has surveyed gamification as a field of study from a human-computer studies perspective. In this paper, we present a systematic survey on the use of gamification in published theoretical reviews and research papers involving interactive systems and human participants. We outline current theoretical understandings of gamification and draw comparisons to related approaches, including alternate reality games (ARGs), games with a purpose (GWAPs), and gameful design. We present a multidisciplinary review of gamification in action, focusing on empirical findings related to purpose and context, design of systems, approaches and techniques, and user impact. Findings from the survey show that a standard conceptualization of gamification is emerging against a growing backdrop of empirical participants-based research. However, definitional subjectivity, diverse or unstated theoretical foundations, incongruities among empirical findings, and inadequate experimental design remain matters of concern. We discuss how gamification may to be more usefully presented as a subset of a larger effort to improve the user experience of interactive systems through gameful design. We end by suggesting points of departure for continued empirical investigations of gamified practice and its effects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "Context: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game-related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game-related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. By achieving these goals, we aim not only to characterize the state of the art on the use of game-related methods on software engineering education, but also to identify gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping study to identify primary studies which address the use, proposal or evaluation of games and their elements on software engineering education. We classified primary studies based on type of approaches, learning goals based on software engineering knowledge areas, and specific characteristics of each type of approach. Results: We identified 156 primary studies, published between 1974 and June 2016. Most primary studies describe the use of serious games (86) and game development (57) for software engineering education, while Gamification is the least explored method (10). Learning goals of these studies and their development of skills are mostly related to the knowledge areas of “Software Process”, “Software Design”, and “Professional Practices”. Conclusions: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, there are some knowledge areas where the use of games can still be further explored. Gamification is a new trend and existing research in the field is quite preliminary. We also noted a lack of standardization both in the definition of learning goals and in the classification of game-related methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification defined as the use of game design elements in nongame contexts or is the integration of game elements, mechanics, and frameworks into nongame situations and scenarios (Horizon Report, 2013). It, so far, has most frequently been used as a clever way to promote a business or product. Besides using gamification in business, there are also examples in education, for example, where in most real cases it is implemented only in the physical classroom. This is the easy way for teachers to integrate game elements for a small group of learners. However, to digitizing the gamification strategy or placing the related mechanisms online is very different, and such issues tend to be not discussed in many of the basic guidelines (Kuo and Chuang, Comput Hum Behav 55:16–27, 2016).This chapter intends to reveal the answer of the questions of (1) which game elements and combinations have been mostly used in the field of open and distance learning, (2) what the distributions of the studies according to the publication type and year are, (3) what the level of studies according to the target audiences (elementary, secondary, higher, and lifelong) are, and (4) what the common findings say. The answers will provide an overview of the research on gamification in Open and Distance Learning. Moreover, the study will be a guideline for the institutes and provide practical information to integrate game elements to online programs successfully.",

Repetitive tasks, particularly when managing unwanted circumstances such as coping with chronic diseases, could be exhausting. Nevertheless, the patients' compliance is needed especially in context of these diseases. Therefore, gamification as a tool for transforming bothersome tasks into rewarding experiences could help to overcome this burden.

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is the use of video-game mechanics and elements in nongame contexts to enhance user engagement and performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards “in-game” and “out-game.” © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a term that refers to the use of game elements in non-game contexts with the goal of engaging people in a variety of tasks. There is a growing interest in gamification as well as its applications and implications in the field of Education since it provides an alternative to engage and motivate students during the process of learning. Despite this increasing interest, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that cover and classify the types of research being published and the most investigated topics in the area. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we carried out a systematic mapping to synthesize an overview of the area. We went through 357 papers on gamification. Among them, 48 were related to education and only 26 met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles defined in this study. These 26 papers were selected and categorized according to their contribution. As a result, we provide an overview of the area. Such an overview suggests that most studies focus on investigating how gamification can be used to motivate students, improve their skills, and maximize learning. Copyright 2014 ACM.",

With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers’ understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach. © 2017, The Author(s).",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(5):  A growing body of papers is exploring a range of learning and behavioral outcomes including: knowledge acquisition outcomes (Jang et al., 2015 ); Laskowski &amp; Badurowicz, 2014; Paiva et al., 2015; Su &amp; Cheng, 2015 ) perceptual outcomes (Christy &amp; Fox, 2014; Codish &amp; Ravid, 2014; Davis &amp; Klein 2015; Pedro et al., 2015b; Sillaots, 2014; Sillaots, 2015; Christy &amp; Fox, 2014 ) behavioral outcomes (Barata et al., 2014; Codish &amp; Ravid, 2015; Hakulinen et al., 2015; Hew et al., 2016; Pedro et al., 2015b) engagement outcomes (Boskic &amp; Hu, 2015; Chang &amp; Wei, 2015; Ibanez et al., 2014; Latulipe et al., 2015; Morschheuser et al., 2014; Poole et al., 2014 ) motivational outcomes (Hasegawa et al., 2015; Herbert et al., 2014; Mekler et al., 2015; Pedro et al., 2015a; Utomo &amp; Santoso, 2015) social outcomes (Hanus &amp; Fox, 2015; Christy &amp; Fox, 2014; Shi et al., 2014). Under the perceptual outcome category, we have included also some works that initiate a new line of studies - the impact of gamification on different demographic groups (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=11\">note on p.11</a>)</p>\n<p>Summary of Table 6: n=10 studies explored behavioral outcomes, n=10 studies explored affective outcomes, n=6 studies explored cognitive outcomes</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">See Table 6.

        "<p>Answer to RQ(6): <br />- In the category of learner-centric, n=31 studies (61%) aim to study behavioral and cognitive effects, n=6 studies (12%) aim to study the effects on different groups of learners, n=4 studies (8%) aim to study the learners' perception of different game mechanics and principles, n=3 studies (6%) aim to study the measures used for assessing the outcomes.<br />- In the category of platform-centric, n=7 studies (13%) aim to study the effect of incorporating selected game elements or game principles into specific learning platforms or experiment with conventional game elements by assigning them new roles (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=16\">note on p.16</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(7): The high expectation for positive outcomes in gamified learning are not confirmed.</p>\n<p>The examination of the papers shows that from the 41 ABC empirical studies only 15 present conclusive evidences for the reported outcomes. In those 15 papers, the findings related to the benefits of gamification are mixed: 12 studies present evidence for positive effects of gamification in educational settings, while 3 present evidence for negative effects. A surprising fact is that the vast majority of the empirical works (25 studies) report inconclusive outcomes, which means that there is no basis for confidence in the reported results</p>\n<p>- As part of affective/behavioral/cognitive (n=41) studies, n=26/41 (64%) studies are inconclusive, n=12/41 (26%) studies are positive, n=3/41 (10%) are negative.

        "<p>Answer to RQ(8): Overall, the bulk of theoretical research addressing gamification maintains that focusing on points and rewards rather than on play and intrinsic engagement cannot always meet the goal of desired behavior change by catering to the intrinsic values of learners (Hansch et al., 2015; Songer &amp; Miyata, 2014; Tomaselli et al., 2015). This suggests a user-centered approach in the design of gamified systems, characterized by a focus on the needs and desires of learners. A new line of research is taking steps towards developing a theory of educational gamification by combining motivational and learning theories aimed at linking gamification to practical education (Landers, 2015; Landers, Bauer, Callan, &amp; Armstrong, 2015) or by developing a framework for integrating gamification with pedagogy (Tulloch, 2014) or psychology of games (Lieberoth, 2015) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=23\">note on p.23</a>)</p>",

We also included the used game elements, mechanics and dynamics since they are inherently related to the success of a gamification application. A number of motivation measures have been used in attempts to establish the effect of gamification on student motivation. In addition to appropriate measures, the verification of the validity of reported results requires availability of relevant statistical information about the studies. In order to provide support for our decision on how conclusive the reported results of a study are, we added the following categories: study sample, study duration, method of data collection, and outcome. Thus the final structure of information to be derived from the reviewed studies included the following categories: game elements, educational level, academic subject, learning activity, study sample, study duration, data collection, and outcome</p>\n<p>See.

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: As the majority of empirical studies reported only performance as measure of motivation, and this is an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">indirect measure, we need more studies with more reliable measures of motivation and a better characterization of learning motivation and outcomes</span>.

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: for advancing the understanding of how to build successful gamified educational systems, there is a need for testing systems that support examining the effect of game elements and experimentally validating it.

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: In general, studies reporting positive results from using a specific combination of game elements do not promote the understanding of the causal effect of the combination, as it is unclear whether the combination or a particular element led to the positive outcome (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=19\">note on p.19</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: There are several assumptions underlying the usefulness of gamification in educational context, such as gamification is motivating, gamification is engaging, gamification can improve attendance and participation. However, research remains inconclusive on these assumptions. Educational contexts in which gamification may be particularly useful have not been confirmed yet. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=26\">note on p.26</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: While self-determination theory provides a good theoretical starting point for studying the motivational dynamics of 'gamified ' educational activities, further research is needed to bridge motivation to a more granular level of game elements and learners ' personalities. Although the connection between motivation and gamification design is demonstrated by a number of the reviewed studies, they do not add persuasive evidence confirming the effect of gamification as a motivational tool. The papers claiming to examine the motivational effects of gamification often report effects on learning outcomes instead on motivation (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=12\">note on p.12</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: While the majority of the reviewed studies do analyze specific educational effects of gamification (on learning, attainment, participation), their focus is often aside from motivation.

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: While the reviewed theoretical studies are touching interesting points, the covered topics are insufficient for complete understanding of the motivational mechanisms of gamification in educational context. Without a theoretical framework backing the design of the studies and the interpretation of their results, it is problematic to select an appropriate gamification structure or to differentiate which of the employed game mechanisms and principles were essential for arriving at successful outcomes. Hence, there is a need of theoretical and empirical studies capable of mutually advancing each other (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=25\">note on p.25</a>)</p>",

In the cases when the OR option was not available in the provided Boolean search functionality, an equivalent search strategy was carried out through multiple searches with alternative terms. This search yielded a total of 4998 results depicted in Table 1. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/XXUDEFYP?page=4\">note on p.4</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: In section \"Search strategy and sources\", it is detailed as follows.<br /><br />We have chosen the definition of (Deterding et al., 2011) for gamification (“the use of game design elements in non‐gaming contexts”) to measure each found publication for relevance. Accordingly, publications discussing full-fledged games were filtered out. Peer-reviewed empirical research papers where no findings were reported were also excluded. For example, purely descriptive papers such as (Morrison &amp; DiSalvo, 2014), which describes the implementation of gamification within Khan Academy, were not included. At the end of this step, all papers that appeared in the review presented in (Dicheva et al., 2015) were also filtered out. The review was restricted to papers appearing in the searched databases between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2015. The result was a list of 51 empirical research papers. In sum, in the past one and a half years, several hundred articles pertaining to gamification in education have been published however only 51 studies met our criteria and are reviewed in this article.<br /><br />For completeness of the review of the research in the field, we decided this time to include also theoretical papers dealing with gamification in education. Following (Seaborn &amp; Fels, 2015), the “theoretical papers” category includes papers that propose an explanation of the underlying nature of gamification in education and such that propose relevant pedagogies or test already existing explanatory models from other domains with respect to gamification. We also added the published literature reviews to the group of theoretical papers. The end result was a list of 11 theoretical papers appearing in the searched databases between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2015. Thus the final number of selected papers (empirical and theoretical) amounted to 63 in total. The last column of Table 1 shows the results after filtering out irrelevant papers and removing duplicates. For comparison, the total number of papers included in the previous review covering the period January 2010–June 2014 was 34.

      "abstractNote": "OBJECTIVE: Smartphone games that aim to alter health behaviours are common, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve this. We systematically reviewed health apps containing gaming elements analysing their embedded behaviour change techniques.\nMETHODS: Two trained researchers independently coded apps for behaviour change techniques using a standard taxonomy. We explored associations with user ratings and price.\nDATA SOURCES: We screened the National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library and all top-rated medical, health and wellness and health and fitness apps (defined by Apple and Google Play stores based on revenue and downloads). We included free and paid English language apps using 'gamification' (rewards, prizes, avatars, badges, leaderboards, competitions, levelling-up or health-related challenges). We excluded apps targeting health professionals.\nRESULTS: 64 of 1680 (4%) health apps included gamification and met inclusion criteria; only 3 of these were in the NHS Library. Behaviour change categories used were: feedback and monitoring (n=60, 94% of apps), reward and threat (n=52, 81%), and goals and planning (n=52, 81%). Individual techniques were: self-monitoring of behaviour (n=55, 86%), non-specific reward (n=49, 82%), social support unspecified (n=48, 75%), non-specific incentive (n=49, 82%) and focus on past success (n=47, 73%). Median number of techniques per app was 14 (range: 5-22). Common combinations were: goal setting, self-monitoring, non-specific reward and non-specific incentive (n=35, 55%); goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success (n=33, 52%). There was no correlation between number of techniques and user ratings (p=0.07; rs=0.23) or price (p=0.45; rs=0.10).\nCONCLUSIONS: Few health apps currently employ gamification and there is a wide variation in the use of behaviour change techniques, which may limit potential to improve health outcomes. We found no correlation between user rating (a possible proxy for health benefits) and game content or price. Further research is required to evaluate effective behaviour change techniques and to assess clinical outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015029841.

      "abstractNote": "Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field. © 2018 The Authors",

      "abstractNote": "Rewards are commonly used in interventions to change behavior, but they can inhibit development of intrinsic motivation, which is associated with long-term behavior maintenance. Gamification is a novel intervention strategy that may target intrinsic motivation through fun and enjoyment. Before the effects of gamified interventions on motivation can be determined, there must be an understanding of how gamified interventions operationalize rewards, such as point systems. The purpose of this review is to determine the prevalence of different reward types, specifically point systems, within gamified interventions. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles. Data sources included Medline OVID, Medline PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and PsycINFO. Out of the 21 articles retrieved, 18 studies described a reward system and were included in this review. Gamified interventions were designed to target a myriad of clinical outcomes across diverse populations. Rewards included points (n = 14), achievements/badges/medals (n = 7), tangible rewards (n = 7), currency (n = 4), other unspecified rewards (n = 3), likes (n = 2), animated feedback (n = 1), and kudos (n = 1). Rewards, and points in particular, appear to be a foundational component of gamified interventions. Despite their prevalence, authors seldom described the use of noncontingent rewards or how the rewards interacted with other game features. The reward systems relying on tangible rewards and currency may have been limited by inhibited intrinsic motivation. As gamification proliferates, future research should explicitly describe how rewards were operationalized in the intervention and evaluate the effects of gamified rewards on motivation across populations and research outcomes. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",

There is some evidence of the efficacy of gamified interventions from 2 of the 18 studies reviewed:</strong><br />---Significant increase in physical activity and decreased utilization of healthcare services was found among participants who received all intervention components. The gaming group, with no social support, had an increase in empowerment compared with the<br />control group.<br />---Full activation in ‘‘BrianGame Brian’’resulted in improved response inhabitation among children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but the effect of external rewards in combination with the game could not be determined because both intervention and control participants received the external rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Preliminary results from 4 quasi-experimental studies also show promise of gamified interventions.</strong></p>\n<p>See Section \"Intervention efficacy\" for more details.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/FJ7VYX6E?page=4\">note on p.96</a>)</p>",

We did not exclude articles by population, publication date, study design, or research outcome because the purpose of this review is to explore the utilization of rewards in all gamified interventions.</p>\n<p>All articles were screened independently for eligibility by Z.H.L. and M.C.S. The two reviewers (Z.H.L. and M.C.S.) independently coded the types of rewards in each study based on the author’s description of the reward. Similar reward types were grouped together based on similar characteristics (e.g., intangible rewards that were provided immediately and frequently as a result of a change in behavior, rewards delivered as a result of the accumulation of points).

Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts.

Method: Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where \"population\" included adults, \"intervention\" involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. \"Comparator\" was a control group, \"outcomes\" included engagement and \"downstream\" outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and \"study design\" included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95% confidence intervals) were also calculated. Results: 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n =5), volume of contributions (n =11) and occasions visited to the software (n =4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n =4) and healthy behaviours (n =1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification. Conclusion: Gamification is effective in increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research into gamification are provided. In particular, rigorous study designs are required to fully examine gamification's effects and determine how to best achieve sustained engagement. © 2017 Looyestyn et al.

Most research to date has evaluated the impact of multiple gamification features used in combination. Preliminary evidence suggests that leader boards may be a particularly useful form of gamification to increase engagement. It appears that<strong> the efficacy of gamification for increasing engagement may have a time effect</strong>, with a clear positive impact in studies conducting activities in a single sitting, with results more mixed for studies examining gamification and engagement over a sustained period.</p>\n<p><br />Engagement was quantified in a number of ways.<strong> The results were generally positive for all forms of engagement</strong>. However, this study also found that <strong>the positive effect of gamification on engagement appeared to lessen over time</strong>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=14\">note on p.14</a>)</p>",

To date, most studies have arisen from European countries. A growing number of publications have appeared each year, with just one eligible publication in 2012, through to seven publications in 2015. A variety of forms of gamification have been examined: mostly leader boards, badges, points and rewards, and commonly in combination. To date, the evaluation of gamification to increase engagement has predominantly related to tertiary education and marketing contexts. Risk of bias assessment suggests that the quality of reporting of studies is reasonably low. This may reflect the fact that this is a young field of scientific endeavour. It is important to also acknowledge that the studies included in this review came from a wide variety of academic disciplines, and reporting conventions vary between disciplines.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">Looyestyn et al 2017:15</a>)</p>\n<p><em>Answer to RQ(1) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"limited detail of which gamification features were used and how they were incorporated in the online program were provided, making it difficult to determine study eligibility and the true intervention effects.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">Looyestyn et al 2017:15</a>)</p>\n<p><em>Flaw on the gamification research (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"The limited reporting of gamification features also impacts potential for study replication.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">Looyestyn et al 2017:15</a>)</p>\n<p><em>Flaw on the gamification research (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"gamification terminology varied to describe features that appeared similar between studies (™badges∫ versus ™rewards∫; ™challenges∫ versus ™quests∫)\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">Looyestyn et al 2017:15</a>)</p>\n<p><em>Flaw on the gamification research (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\"Recommendations for future research\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=16\">Looyestyn et al 2017:16</a>)</p>\n<p><em>Research agenda (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/K6I3WMJG?page=16\">note on p.16</a>)</em></p>",

      "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive tasks are typically viewed as effortful, frustrating, and repetitive, which often leads to participant disengagement. This, in turn, may negatively impact data quality and/or reduce intervention effects. However, gamification may provide a possible solution. If game design features can be incorporated into cognitive tasks without undermining their scientific value, then data quality, intervention effects, and participant engagement may be improved.\nOBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to explore and evaluate the ways in which gamification has already been used for cognitive training and assessment purposes. We hope to answer 3 questions: (1) Why have researchers opted to use gamification? (2) What domains has gamification been applied in? (3) How successful has gamification been in cognitive research thus far?\nMETHODS: We systematically searched several Web-based databases, searching the titles, abstracts, and keywords of database entries using the search strategy (gamif* OR game OR games) AND (cognit* OR engag* OR behavi* OR health* OR attention OR motiv*). Searches included papers published in English between January 2007 and October 2015.\nRESULTS: Our review identified 33 relevant studies, covering 31 gamified cognitive tasks used across a range of disorders and cognitive domains. We identified 7 reasons for researchers opting to gamify their cognitive training and testing. We found that working memory and general executive functions were common targets for both gamified assessment and training. Gamified tests were typically validated successfully, although mixed-domain measurement was a problem. Gamified training appears to be highly engaging and does boost participant motivation, but mixed effects of gamification on task performance were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneous study designs and typically small sample sizes highlight the need for further research in both gamified training and testing. Nevertheless, careful application of gamification can provide a way to develop engaging and yet scientifically valid cognitive assessments, and it is likely worthwhile to continue to develop gamified cognitive tasks in the future.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification has become one of the most notable technological developments for human engagement. Therefore, it is not surprising that gamification has especially been addressed and implemented in the realm of education where supporting and retaining engagement is a constant challenge. However, while the volume of research on the topic has increased, synthesizing the consequent knowledge has remained modest and narrow. Therefore, in this literature review we catalogue 128 empirical research papers in the field of gamification of education and learning. The results indicate that gamification in education and learning most commonly utilizes affordances signaling achievement and progression, while social and immersion-oriented affordances are much less common; the outcomes examined in the studies are mainly focused on quantifiable performance metrics; and the results reported in the reviewed studies are strongly positively oriented. The findings imply that future research on gamification in education should increasingly put emphasis on varying the affordances in the implementations and the pursued goals of the gamification solutions. We encourage also increased attention on contextual factors of the solutions as well as on study designs in future research endeavors. © 2018 CEUR-WS. All Rights Reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "The use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. Most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. Nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. In this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. Analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010–2014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. Main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. Future research lines are also addressed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the use of games in education: Games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. Games support active learning. Games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. What this paper adds to this: This study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. This study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. This study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. This study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. Findings for practitioners: Relevant researchers and institutions to collaborate with. Topics and themes under research.

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a review of the literature on gamification design frameworks. Gamification, understood as the use of game design elements in other contexts for the purpose of engagement, has become a hot topic in the recent years. However, there's also a cautionary tale to be extracted from Gartner's reports on the topic: many gamification-based solutions fail because, mostly, they have been created on a whim, or mixing bits and pieces from game components, without a clear and formal design process. The application of a definite design framework aims to be a path to success. Therefore, before starting the gamification of a process, it is very important to know which frameworks or methods exist and their main characteristics. The present review synthesizes the process of gamification design for a successful engagement experience. This review categorizes existing approaches and provides an assessment of their main features, which may prove invaluable to developers of gamified solutions at different levels and scopes. © 2015 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "Learner’s motivation difficulties are recognized as a problem in diverse educational scenarios, reaching up to university degrees. Among other techniques that are often applied by instructors to counteract this issue, those related to the use of gaming elements seem to very promising. In this context, considering the use of game-like properties in learning scenarios, known as gamification, has received increasing interest by academia in recent years. However, its application in higher education can be challenging, due to some unwanted effects caused by the lack of proven design methodologies have been detected. Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers. A total of 2314 unique works are initially recorded, based on queries in databases, libraries, journals and search engines. After applying a systematic filtering process, a definitive list of 40 works is more closely analysed. Next to review over relevant literature, an assessment of the main features found in the discussed approaches is given, while also categorizing them according to their main application field and its suitability in higher educational environments. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

      "abstractNote": "This study investigates how different gamification implementations can increase crowdsourcees' motivation and participation in crowdsourcing (CS). To this end, we review empirical literature that has investigated the use of gamification in crowdsourcing settings. Overall, the results of the review indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation. When comparing crowdcreating, -solving, -processing and-rating CS approaches, the results show differences in the use of gamification across CS types. Crowdsourcing initiatives that provide more monotonous tasks most commonly used mere points and other simpler gamification implementations, whereas CS initiatives that seek for diverse and creative contributions have employed gamification in more manifold ways employing a richer set of mechanics. These findings provide insights for designers of gamified systems and further research on the topics of gamification and crowdsourcing. © 2016 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "Two parallel phenomena are gaining attention in human–computer interaction research: gamification and crowdsourcing. Because crowdsourcing's success depends on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing, and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects of the phenomenon. The paper's main contributions are derived through a systematic literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

To answer this question, this paper presents initial results of a broader scoping review of gamification research published between 2010 and 2016. Close to 2,000 peer-reviewed English-language journal and conference papers were identified across 11 databases and categorized by discipline. Results indicate an explosive growth of literature peaking in 2015. Early on, Information and Computing Science dominated the field, to be overtaken by the sum of other disciplines in 2013, education, economics and tourism in specific. This indicates that gamification was initially a field within computer science and HCI and has only recently become truly multi-disciplinary. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a relatively new trend that focuses on applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to engage audiences and to inject a little fun into mundane activities besides generating motivational and cognitive benefits. While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

Does the paper present a detailed description of the game elements employed? The possible answers were ‘‘Yes (+1)”, ‘‘No (+0)” and ‘‘Partially (+0.5)”.</em></p>\n<p><em>---QA2. Does the study present empirical results?</em><br /><em>The possible answers were ‘‘Yes (+1)” and No ‘‘(+0)”.</em></p>\n<p><em>---QA3. Are the limitations of gamification addressed explicitly? The possible answers were ‘‘Yes (+1)” and No ‘‘(+0)”.</em></p>\n<p><em>---QA4. Does the paper discuss the benefits of gamification? The possible answers were ‘‘Yes (+1)” and No ‘‘(+0)”.</em></p>\n<p><em>---QA5. Has the study been published in a relevant journal or conference proceedings?</em></p>\n<p>This quality assessment question was rated by considering the CORE 2014 and Journal Citation Reports 2014 (JCR); rankings of conferences and journals, respectively. The possible answers to<br />this question were:</p>\n<p><em>for conferences, workshops, and symposia:</em><br /><em>o (+1.5) if it is ranked CORE A</em><br /><em>o (+1) If it is ranked CORE B</em><br /><em>o (+0.5) If it is ranked CORE C</em><br /><em>o (+0) If it is not in the CORE ranking</em><br /><em>for journals:</em><br /><em>o (+2) If it is ranked Q1</em><br /><em>o (+1.5) If it is ranked Q2</em><br /><em>o (+1) If it is ranked Q3 or Q4</em><br /><em>o (+0) if it has no JCR ranking</em><br /><em>for others: (+0).</em></p>\n<p>Question QA1 scores partially when the paper does not provide details about the game elements employed in the application. The differentiation made as regards the score for question QA5 is owing to the fact that it is usually more complicated to publish in ranked journals than in conferences or symposia. The highest quality assessment score that could be given to a paper was 6, (i.e., the total score is an integer between 0 and 6).</p>\n<p> (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/MYFH6CBD?page=3\">note on p.33</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Research agenda: (1)Researchers need to pay considerable attention to the motivational side of the gamified applications and serious games. <strong>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation should be tuned up to yield a permanent engagement with the application.</strong></p>\n<p>(2)Moreover, the findings of this review show that the majority of the studies reported evaluations during a short period of time, which actually diminished the accuracy of the results. <strong>The gamified applications and serious games, especially those dealing with therapy and prevention, must therefore undergo empirical evaluations that span longer periods so as to better explore the long-term viability of the game mechanics being integrated.</strong></p>\n<p>(3)In addition,<strong> patients diagnosed with the health condition in question should be involved from the first stage of the development of the application or the game</strong>.

Of 534 papers, 474 were excluded after the application of EC4. The remaining 60 papers were evaluated by considering their full texts. 19 articles were discarded and 41 articles focusing on both gamification and serious gaming in e-Health were selected after applying EC4. Five more articles were identified after checking the reference list of each selected study (snowballing technique).

      "abstractNote": "The use of videogames in healthcare interventions is gaining popularity, but there is still a gap in the understanding on how these types of interventions are used for the management of diabetes. The purpose of this review is to examine published research on the use of videogames for diabetes management. With the increased use of mobile technology, the review was expanded to understand whether games, gamification, and virtual environments can be used for diabetes self-management. Out of the 307 articles identified, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria of the study. The duration of most studies was short, with small sample sizes. All interventions targeted behavioral changes examining risk reduction of diabetes-related risk and promotion of healthy behavior among study participants. Videogames appeared to be helpful tools for education in some interventions, whereas gamification and virtual environments increased extrinsic motivation and provided positive reinforcement. This review concludes by discussing the potential of using videogames and gamification for the self-management of diabetes. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.",

      "abstractNote": "Trying to take advantage of the growing passion for games, Gamification is a trending phenomenon that aims at motivating people by applying elements common to games in different contexts. While first applications of Gamification exist in finance, health, education and entertainment, utility of Gamification in various contexts has not been sufficiently explored. Aiming to understand how Gamification can be applied to information systems to increase end-user motivation, we performed a systematic literature review to identify game elements used in Gamification. Our study yields a synthesis of mechanics and dynamics in five clusters - system design, challenges, rewards, social influences and user specifics. While our study reveals that Gamification has potential for motivating information system end-users, we also discuss the potential risks. Future research should analyse concrete implementations of Gamification in information systems contexts and investigate related long-term effects. From a practical perspective, we present Gamification as an innovative approach to enhancing end-user motivation to utilise information systems and illustrate the various options that can be applied to design Gamification applications.",

      "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Adherence to effective Web-based interventions for common mental disorders (CMDs) and well-being remains a critical issue, with clear potential to increase effectiveness. Continued identification and examination of \"active\" technological components within Web-based interventions has been called for. Gamification is the use of game design elements and features in nongame contexts. Health and lifestyle interventions have implemented a variety of game features in their design in an effort to encourage engagement and increase program adherence. The potential influence of gamification on program adherence has not been examined in the context of Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being.\nOBJECTIVE: This study seeks to review the literature to examine whether gaming features predict or influence reported rates of program adherence in Web-based interventions designed to manage CMDs and well-being.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to manage CMDs or well-being and incorporated gamification features. Seven electronic databases were searched.\nRESULTS: A total of 61 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and 47 different intervention programs were identified. The majority were designed to manage depression using cognitive behavioral therapy. Eight of 10 popular gamification features reviewed were in use. The majority of studies utilized only one gamification feature (n=58) with a maximum of three features. The most commonly used feature was story/theme. Levels and game leaders were not used in this context. No studies explicitly examined the role of gamification features on program adherence. Usage data were not commonly reported. Interventions intended to be 10 weeks in duration had higher mean adherence than those intended to be 6 or 8 weeks in duration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gamification features have been incorporated into the design of interventions designed to treat CMD and well-being. Further research is needed to improve understanding of gamification features on adherence and engagement in order to inform the design of future Web-based health interventions in which adherence to treatment is of concern. Conclusions were limited by varied reporting of adherence and usage data.",

      "abstractNote": "In the quest to engage and motivate users on the use of mobile applications, the gamification concept has been excelling in the market since incorporates game elements in a non-game context. Scoring systems, challenges, competitions and badges, are some of the elements implemented in many fields, such as health, education, ecological awareness, among others. In this context, this study aimed to systematically review available literature to identify gamification strategies used in mobile applications. A search was conducted in ACM, Science Direct and Scopus databases, from March to June 2016. A total of 402 studies were found, 23 of which met the eligibility criteria. The results demonstrated the heterogeneity of gamification elements being used and the impact they caused in the applications, especially as a motivational factor for users. This study provides the basis for future research on gamification methods and emphasizes the importance of this concept to increase engagement and provide enjoyment to users. © 2017 AISTI.",

      "abstractNote": "One of the main tensions in both media studies and education studies can be found in the discourse on the impact of digital media on audiences and learners as connected to a dichotomy of risks and affordances. Contemporary forms of media literacy build on multiple forms of literacy to support critical analysis and critical production in a variety of forms as central to learning. This study reviews research on games and learning conducted from 2010-2016 and published in SAGE Publications, ACM publications, iEEE, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases from a sample of 52 peer reviewed articles. The review of the literature analyzes variables such as authorship, paradigms and learning theories, research questions and methodologies and type of the games used in game-based learning. The central research questions for this literature review build on a history of games for learning and seek to identify good practices that can be used to design meaningful learning experiences and to inform future research related to game-based learning. © 2016, Journal of Content, Community & Communication.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification has been applied to a large diversity of settings in recent years, with encouraging and promising results. In the Software Engineering context, there are some research works that focused on the application of gamification in Requirements Engineering that need to be better analyzed and understood. Does gamification impact RE? What are the gamification elements that have been used? What sub-processes and RE tasks have been the subject of gamification? The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic review to characterize the state of the art of gamification in RE, answering those and other questions, identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. It was conducted a systematic review to find the primary studies in the existent literature which objectives is applying gamification to RE and its sub-processes. As a result of the systematic review, 8 primary studies were analyzed. They were published between 2012 and 2017 and most of them focus on the application of gamification onto elicitation, negotiation and prioritization. © 2018 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "Context: Gamification focuses on the improvement of users' engagement when performing tasks by making use of game mechanics and elements in order to increase their motivations. Many researches have developed gamification models supporting a variety of motivational characteristics to provide engagement solutions for different areas. Objective: This paper carries out a systematic mapping in the field of gamification, looking for models with motivational characteristics in an attempt to characterise the state of the art of this field, identifying gaps and tendencies for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping aiming at finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analysed according to twelve criteria. Results: We analysed 70 papers that resulted in 17 primary studies, published until September 2016. Most of them focus on Education, making use of Gamification to increase the motivation of a learning process. The gamification mechanics and elements most used were Badges/Achievements and Points/ExperiencePoints(XP), and most of the studies were not validated, thus not providing empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is somehow preliminary, and more research effort to analyse the applicability of the models and their respective evaluations would be needed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: A possible gap found in this analysis is the use of ontologies to represent the knowledge of the models.

        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: Another research gap which we found during the study is the lack of user type analysis. Although some models analysed the whole scenario of possibilities, many of them followed the same trend, thus also choosing the same motivational factors. Unpopular user types like Disruptor and Philanthropist certainly have a space in some domains, although they were completely ignored by many models (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/9QP9FGVV?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Flaw on the gamification research: Most of the studies we have analysed focus on Education, commonly referred as 'Gamification of Learning'.

A recommendation of Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015) is to have two authors involved in this step, where one extracts the data and the other checks the correctness of the extracted data. Therefore, to reduce the researcher bias, the corresponding author followed the same review technique of Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015), which consists in trace back the information in the extraction form to the statements in each paper, and check their correctness.

        "<p>Research agenda: A research opportunity we found is the development of gamification models that comply with all of the focused questions proposed in this study. We identified many combinations, but with most of them only answering positively in up to half of the questions. We believe that a model with generic purposes, making use of the benefits of ontologies, organising all of the gamification user types and their motivations in profiles to provide adaptability and personalisation, surely covers the existing research gaps highlighted in this work and deserves a full evaluation to validate the aforementioned concepts, thus proving its applicability (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/9QP9FGVV?page=15\">note on p.15</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Search strategy: Search methods like Snowballing (Wohlin 2014) differ from Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015) guidelines in terms of primary search results width. Snowballing requires a balanced seed of relevant papers covering different years, publishers and authors (Wohlin 2014), where new papers are selected throughout new iterations. On the other hand, the guidelines have no distinction in preliminary search results and usually cover different scientific search databases. In this way, Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015) approach might result in a larger primary set of papers. However, both approaches (guidelines and Snowballing) could miss relevant papers, due to an unbalanced set of papers, in the case of Snowballing (Wohlin 2014) method, or due to a lack of a database, in the case of Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015) guidelines.

        "<p>Search strategy: The scope of the search considers academic publications (journals, conferences and workshops) over six different search engines (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer Link and Wiley Online Library), applying the terms of the search string to abstracts, keywords and titles. We looked for the major open search scientific databases containing peerreviewed publications from Computer Science and Information Technology subjects. All chosen databases have more than 1 million indexed publications. Alternative (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/9QP9FGVV?page=3\">note on p.3</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: The search process and criteria may have restricted access to studies in such a way that relevant jobs in the search area may have been removed. To mitigate this risk, the techniques presented by Petersen et al. (2008) and Petersen, Vakkalanka, and Kuzniarz (2015) were used, which were also applied in studies by Gonales et al. (2015), Dias, Barbosa, and Vianna (2017) and Vianna and Barbosa (2017). Figure 1 shows the different steps present in the studies filtering process. The searches were performed following the search string shown in Table 2 and in the Initial Search step a total of 1366 articles were returned over six different search engines. The searches were conducted at the end of September 2016, and no searchfilter was applied in this first return, such as a publication date limit period. In the secondfiltering step we performed an Impurity Removal, this time applying the inclusion criteria (IC2) and the exclusion criteria (EC2) and (EC4), resulting in a reduction of the total number of results in 33.8%, totalling 905 works at the end of this step. Subsequently, wefiltered the studies by title, where the exclusion criteria (EC1) and (EC3) were applied. This step was the most thorough since it required a careful reading of each title in order to try to identify the main purpose of each work. As a result, it was possible to reduce the number of works to be mapped by 85.8%, which resulted in a total of 129 works. In the fourth step, we performed afiltering by abstract, applying the inclusion criteria (IC1). After the unification of results from different search engines (Combination step), a reduction of 31.8% in the total number of results was observed, totalling 88 papers. In the subsequent step, we applied the exclusion criteria (EC5) to remove the duplicate studies, eliminating 22.7% (20) of the works resulting from the previous step. In the next step (Addition by Heuristics), we added two papers compatible with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the systematic mapping that were not returned in any of the search engines, increasing the number of results by 2.9%. From the 70 papers resulting from the previous step, 71.4% of them were removed by applying the inclusion criteria (IC1) and (IC3) throughout the text (Filter by Full Text step), resulting in a total of 20 selected papers. Analysing the 20 works selected in thefiltering step, it was observed that some studies from the same author or research group were technically similar, being updates of previously published studies. Thus, only the most representative study was selected and the remainder removed. Consequently, 3 studies were excluded (15%), totalling 17 selected representative works, which are listed in Appendix 1.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/9QP9FGVV?page=5\">note on p.5</a>)</p>",

      "abstractNote": "Depression is a common mental disorder that causes sadness and loss of interest. It affects 350 million people in the world and its most severe state can lead to suicide. Many technologies are being used to aid the depression treatment and gamification has been used as an approach to improve adherence and engagement in the treatment. This systematic study aimed at identifying how gamification and serious games have been applied to support the treatment of depression, what technologies are being used currently and what gaps are still left unexplored. Eight scientific repositories were used to search for papers in the area of depression and a filter process was used to remove bias. As a result of this search and filter process, 28 works were completely reviewed, analyzed and categorized in this paper. In the reviewed papers the technologies found for treatment of depression were mobile, computer, wearables and web applications. These technologies are applied in gamification, serious games, virtual reality and speech analysis. Some papers used Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as an intervention and other papers used gamification as a way to promote engagement and adherence to treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstractNote": "Educational practitioners are always looking for new and better ways to scaffold student learning; the latest approach that has become popular is called gamification.The aim of this research is to explore the concept of gamification and to review current research and publications about gamification for education. To do so, the systematic analysis of publications was chosen as research method. During the research, 91 articles published since 2012, obtained via the “Scopus” and “SAGE Publications” databases, were reviewed. Articles were classified by publication year, research areas, longitude, research methodology and used keywords in the articles.The study shows that there is little research that gives comprehensive insight into the concept of gamification for education, because the concept of gamification is relatively new. But gamification has a positive impact on student motivation and attitude changes.",

Although the literature to date has provided relevant contributions in explaining how gamification design can be effective, several studies seek to address the constructs used to measure the effects of gamification. To analyze how gamification outcomes should be properly measured, this paper systematically reviews the literature and provides a map of the most frequent scales used to measure gamification outcomes in the educational context. As research findings, we identify motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and flow/cognitive absorption as the primary constructs addressed to experiential outcomes. Additionally, there are research opportunities to develop a better understanding of the effects of extrinsic motivation rewards on experiential outcomes and problem-solving transfer posited as instrumental outcome. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "In today's technological era, emerging educational technologies, such as digital badges, have shown the potential for fostering student learning. To examine the major considerations undergirding the design of digital badges used in an educational context, a conceptual literature review of multidisciplinary electronic databases oriented towards computing and education was undertaken. The three core design dimensions found in our analysis were the specific function of badges, the structure of badge systems, and the different types of design and interaction features used with badges. We highlight the main effects of studies addressing these dimensions and provide recommendations and suggestions for further research to educational stakeholders who seek to better understand how to implement badges within their own institutions. © 2008-2011 IEEE.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.1): This review lists 3 purposes for which a badge system is to be used. The purposes and corresponding number of studies found are:<br />(1)Motivation, engagement and participation (n = 37)<br />(2)Awareness, Behaviour change and self-regulated learning (n = 5)<br />(3)Recognition of achievement, skill accomplishment and certification or assessment (n = 19)</p>\n<p>Main findings:</p>\n<p><strong>(1)Motivation, engagement and participation</strong></p>\n<p>---Findings:<br />Different types of badges affected learner motivations differently;<br />Combining badges with information on relative, peer performance is<br />effective Positive motivational effects;<br />neutral or negative motivational effects; <br />did not undermine motivation but did not foster disciplinary engagement;<br />Increased engagement; <br />No effect or guarantee of engagement; <br />More efficient for engaging younger than older users;<br />Gamification increased participation; <br />participation varies according to usage of badge system; <br />lower participation compared to social networking; <br />earning badges not important.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>(2)Awareness, Behaviour change and self-regulated learning</strong></p>\n<p>---Findings:<br />Badges can influence behaviour; badges inform but does not influence practice.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>(3)Recognition of achievement, skill accomplishment and certification or assessment</strong></p>\n<p>---Findings:<br />Leads to empowerment and value; <br />achievement badges not found to be particularly motivating or demotivating; <br />badges created and used by various groups to recognize activities in and out of school; <br />main benefits are recognition and confirmation of assignments demonstrating badge potential in formal higher education.</p>\n<p>See Section 2.4.1 and TABLE 3 \"Summary of Results by Badge Function\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/ZEUQGR9V?page=3\">note on p.538</a>) for more details.</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.2): According to Table 4 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/ZEUQGR9V?page=4\">note on p.539</a>) ,the structural features of badges systems are:</p>\n<p>(1)Progressive/Milestone badges (n = 7)</p>\n<p>(2)Outcomes-based badges (n = 2)</p>\n<p>(3)Categorized badges (n = 3)</p>\n<p>(4)Hidden/Locked badges (n = 7)</p>\n<p>(5)Complex connection structures (n = 4)</p>\n<p>(6)Course section badges (n = 2)</p>\n<p>(7)Nominated/, custom/ group/ starter badges (n = 6)</p>\n<p>(8)Negative badges (n = 2)</p>\n<p>(9)Contribution to student grades (n = 2)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.3): According to Table 5 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/ZEUQGR9V?page=5\">note on p.540</a>) , the design and interaction features of badges systems are:</p>\n<p>(1)Visual appeal (n = 5)</p>\n<p>(2)Information on badges (n = 4)</p>\n<p>(3)Notification of badges earned (n = 4)</p>\n<p>(4)Badge dashboard (n = 2)</p>\n<p>(5)Badge leaderboard (n = 7)</p>\n<p>(6)Tracking progress (n = 6)</p>\n<p>(7)Badge Socialization (n = 14)</p>\n<p>(8)Personalization and customization (n = 4)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.4): (1) the need for motivating and engaging learners is not restricted to a particular educational level, (2) the reviewed studies on university professional development programs (practice teachers, librarians) appear to implement outcomes-based badges closely aligned to learning goals, (3) badges can have positive effects across educational levels.

      "abstractNote": "Gamification has increasingly been applied to various life domains and environments, including work and the workplace. Accordingly, research on gamification has grown considerably in the past years. This study presents a systematic review of the theoretical and empirical literature produced in the past 11 years about the application of gamification to the work domain. We analyze the available literature about why gamification is important in work and human resources management, how it can be guided, and which are the examples of gamification in this domain. The systematic review was based on 35 articles, including theoretical papers, empirical (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods) studies, case studies, and other types of papers (presentation of new resources for gamification). Findings are summarized in terms of the sample, country of the study, study type, main results, and gamification and work dimen sions associated. The results show that research on the applications of gamifica tion in the workplace is scarce and mostly exploratory. Most studies were conducted using quantitative methods, but with small samples and simple research designs. Although the literature suggests evidence for the usefulness and appropriateness of gamification in the workplace, there are significant limitations in the research, translating a gap between HR practitioners’ concerns and academic developments in this field. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1):<br />- A total of 17 independent samples, ranging from 8 [16] to 3486 participants [17]. Samples tended to include a very low number of participants, except for some quantitative studies that used more robust samples (e.g., [18-21])<br />- Research teams from Germany [22-27] were the ones who contributed most for the topic. Most of the studies were empirical, using quantitative designs (e.g., [18-21, 25 ], but theoretical papers were also very frequent (e.g., [5, 28-31])</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KPSZJH37?page=4\">note on p.286</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(2): The most common categories found in the selected studies for this review were Motivation, Training, Engagement, and Selection (by this order) (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KPSZJH37?page=5\">note on p.287</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(3): The application of gamification to the workplace found that gamification seems to yield high levels of motivation and engagement, [18, 26, 42] learning [21], and of performance and effectiveness in organizational implementation processes [18, 22-24]. In addition, gamification also seems to positively contribute to collaborative work and team performance [35, 38], enjoyment and well-being [20]. However, while increasing speed in performance, gamification can also lead to the production of more errors [ 24] (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KPSZJH37?page=5\">note on p.287</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(4):<br />- theoretical papers were mostly concerned with the exploration of a framework to justify the application of gamification to the work domain [10, 30, 43, 45] describing involved learning and motivation processes [27-29, 31, 45, 47]<br />- focused on the presentation of tools and guidelines for such an application [5, 27, 30, 45, 46]. Finally, we analyzed some studies that presented new apps or other online resources for gamification [34, 37, 39, 40] (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KPSZJH37?page=6\">note on p.288</a>)</p>",

        "<p>Selection procedure: Selection of the reviews was conducted in three rounds. In the first round, we included conference papers, articles, book chapters and conference reviews. The first round of analysis consisted of the title and abstract screening, in which four reviewers screened part of the retrieved records. Each of the four reviewers (ATF, AMA, SF, and IM) screened a quarter of the records independently. Records were screened based on adequacy towards the research question. We eliminated studies that were systematic reviews and repeated entries were then identified and excluded. In the second round, a single reviewer read and integrated all results in a single document (ATF). In the third round, four reviewers (ATF, AMA, SF, and IM) analyzed quarters of the selected articles independently and the search was refined. We limited our search to articles and conference papers, excluding book chapters due to a probable higher theoretical load, which was not the main focus of this study. Repeated entries were then identified and excluded. Articles were retrieved for full examination, in order to decide for inclusion in our study. Studies that were not fully available were eliminated. We then read the studies and evaluated fit for the review's goal. At this step, we eliminated studies that presented data on the application of gami‐ fication to educational contexts and instructional processes, and that weren't related with our research question. We also eliminated articles that were not written in English. Results were compiled and two reviewers (ATF and AMA) conducted a final review considering the need for a full integration of criterion. During the process of selection, disagreements were resolved by obtaining consensus during several meetings with all reviewers.

However, health researchers and providers have only just begun to utilize new technologies to deliver medical education online and through smartphone-based applications. Gamification, an increasingly popular method to produce positive behavioral change, has become a source of interest for private industry as well as academic researchers. In this review, we conducted literature searches to provide an initial framework for researchers to classify gamification studies. We provide a short list of popular gamification elements to help develop a definition for gamification in healthcare. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: There is a worldwide shortage of health workers, and this issue requires innovative education solutions. Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. Results: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. Conclusions: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction. However, the available evidence is mostly of low quality and calls for further rigorous, theory-driven research. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.",

      "abstractNote": "As gamification literature has matured, the gap between how different domains apply the theory has widened. This has positioned gamification as being more dependent on context, rather than being an independent theory per se. To address this notion, three concepts are identified as being central for how a gamificator, the one responsible for gamifying, gamifies a process. These are mechanics, mental mediators and desired outcomes. Following this logic, a review was conducted using 77 (n) articles across seven disciplines, namely health and wellness, crowdsourcing, sustainability, computer science, software development, business, and tourism. The findings highlighted potentially causal and correlational relationships between several concepts when gamifying a situation, context, service or/and process. This research presents an alternative and uniform perspective on the broad gamification research to better understand how gamification functions and can be employed to impact various outcomes. Furthermore, this research contributes to this rather eclectic domain, presenting a more categorized view in showing domain-specific mechanics and how these can be employed for empirical testing. Lastly, the conceptual model can be modified, employed and adjusted to investigate various effects of gamification on outcomes.",

      "abstractNote": "Offering training programs to their employees is one of the necessary tasks that managers must comply with. Training is done mainly to provide up-to-date knowledge or to convey to staff the objectives, history, corporate name, functions of the organization’s areas, processes, laws, norms or policies that must be fulfilled. Although there are a lot of methods, models or tools that are useful for this purpose, many companies face with some common problems like employee’s motivation and high costs in terms of money and time. In an effort to solve this problem, new trends have emerged in the last few years, in particular strategies related to games, such as serious games and gamification, whose success has been demonstrated by numerous researchers. According to the above, we present a systematic literature review of the different approaches that have used games or their elements, using the procedure suggested by Cooper, on this matter, ending with about the positive and negative findings. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

      "abstractNote": "The term gamification and gamified systems are a trending area of research. However, gamification can indicate several different things, such as applying the game-like elements into the design of the user interface of a software, but not all gamification is necessarily associated with software products. Overall, it is unclear what different aspects are studied under the umbrella of ‘gamification’, and what is the current state of the art in the gamification research. In this paper, 1164 gamification studies are analyzed and classified based on their focus areas and the research topics to establish what the research trends in gamification are. Based on the results, e-learning and proof-of-concept studies in the ecological lifestyle and sustainability, assisting computer science studies and improving motivation are the trendiest areas of gamification research. Currently, the most common types of research are the proof-of-concept studies, and theoretical works on the different concepts and elements of gamification. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

So far, only a few experimental studies regarding the influence of gamification on survey responding have been published in peer-reviewed journals. This article systematically reviews the current research literature on gamification in surveys by first answering the question as to what gamification entails in the context of web surveys by identifying relevant gamification elements. Next, the article discusses how these elements could influence survey data quality using the Total Survey Error framework. Finally, a systematic review of empirical evidence on gamified surveys from published and unpublished studies is provided. While most studies found in our literature review reported a positive effect of using game elements, such as challenges, story/narrative, rewards, goals/objectives, and badges, on psychological outcomes among survey respondents (e.g., fun, interest, satisfaction), the influence of these elements on behavioral outcomes (e.g., completion and break-offs, item omission, satisficing, responses) and, therefore, survey quality is more unclear. This article informs survey researchers and practitioners of the current state of research on survey gamification and identifies potential areas for future research. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",

      "abstractNote": "A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a type of online learning environment that has the potential to increase students' access to education. However, the low completion rates in MOOCs suggest that student engagement and progression in the courses are problematic. Following the increasing adoption of gamification in education, it is possible that gamification can also be effectively adopted in MOOCs to enhance students' motivation and increase completion rates. Yet at present, the extent to which gamification has been examined in MOOCs is not known. Considering the myriad gamification elements that can be adopted in MOOCs (e.g., leaderboards and digital badges), this theoretical research study reviews scholarly publications examining gamification of MOOCs. The main purpose is to provide an overview of studies on gamification in MOOCs, types of research studies, theories applied, gamification elements implemented, methods of implementation, the overall impact of gamification in MOOCs, and the challenges faced by researchers and practitioners when implementing gamification in MOOCs. The results of the literature study indicate that research on gamification in MOOCs is in its early stages. While there are only a handful of empirical research studies, results of the experiments generally showed a positive relation between gamification and student motivation and engagement. It is concluded that there is a need for further studies using educational theories to account for the effects of employing gamification in MOOCs. © 2018 IEEE.",

In this context, gamification is a tool often used to improve the teaching-learning process by helping both teachers and students reach their goals in the short, medium and long term. Given its importance both for the academia and for society in general, this article wishes to do a systematic review of the literature on the use of gamification as a tool to enhance the quality of the teaching process, in general, and, in particular, the teaching of management. In order to do so, it will focus on the most relevant literature on the application of gamification to educational contexts, while describing gamification's main themes and constructs, using a systematic approach based on a research protocol and refinement criteria that include precise research and literature review stages, resorting to scientific articles that have been published and are part of the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases. The paper concludes by proposing a research model based on four main constructs derived from this systematic literature review in order to help futures studies about gamification in education.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.1): Section 3.1.1 introduced <strong>motivation</strong>, the 1st construct proposed in this literature review (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KY3DI2Q4?page=3\">note on p.337</a>), including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">what is motivation</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the categories of motivation</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">how motivation affects learning,</span> etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to Section 3.1.1:</p>\n<p>\"Motivation theories are quite common in GBL literature, since motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain the students’ will to begin, direct, and strengthen their learning process in a persistent manner (Maehr &amp; Meyer 1997).</p>\n<p><br />Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain the direction, intensity, persistence and quality of a given human behaviour (Maehr &amp; Meyer 1997). Motivation, whether intrinsic or extrinsic, is used as a mediator variable that accounts for several types of behaviour in different contexts and environments (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000). In education, it is considered a key element in learning and used to explain the effort and attention invested by students in the activities in which they are involved (Brophy 2013). In this context, it is up to the teachers to manage students’ motivation, raising it when possible, so that the learning process has positive results (Harlen &amp; Deakin Crick 2003).</p>\n<p>Hence the importance of gamification, made clear by many studies (Su 2016; Bittner &amp; Shipper 2014; Koivisto 2013) which show that the elements of a game may increase student’s levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. However, one should bear in mind that intrinsic motivation levels are positively increased when tasks otherwise viewed as dull become interesting, but they fall when extrinsic motivation levels rise, leading students to feel less excited about performing the tasks that have been assigned to them.</p>\n<p>These statements concur with the Self-Determination Theory (Deci &amp; Ryan 1985) and are based on research on gamification (Caillois 2001), according to which rewards and incentives cause intrinsic motivation to weaken. In a comparative, longitudinal study involving two groups of students (one of them a control group which did not use the game), it was observed that the rewards and incentives offered reduced the motivation and negatively affected the results of the group that used the game compared to the control group (Hanus &amp; Fox 2015), proving that rewarding negatively affects motivation.</p>\n<p>In short, gamification mainly targets the extrinsic motivation, although its effects are not uniformly distributed among all the students of a given classroom. Therefore, new techniques must be found and applied so that there is a balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Dichev et al. 2014), thus ensuring that students may benefit from the advantages of gamification (Hamari, 2013).\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.2): Section 3.1.2 introduced<strong> flow</strong>, the 2nd construct proposed in this literature review (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KY3DI2Q4?page=4\">note on p.338</a>),  including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">what is flow</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">how flow state can be associated with learning,</span> etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to Section 3.1.2:</p>\n<p>\"Educational games are developed to educate and train, integrating serious work elements into a game context. This integration is called flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1990). The flow is a mental state characterised by a high concentration and focus on tasks that cause high pleasure and intense intrinsic motivation (Shernoff, Kratochwill, &amp; Stoiber, 2003). Studies on the flow have concluded that challenging tasks lead to high concentration, absorption and immersion.</p>\n<p><br />The flow has been associated with learning, developing of talent, academic performance and creative achievement, regardless of the task or job (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996). In their studies, Hamari and Koivisto (2014) and Procci, Singer, Levy, and Bowers (2012) have found out that game-based technologies promote and conjure up flow experiences capable of having a positive effect on the quality of the learning and of the academic performance (Hung, Sun, &amp; Yu, 2015; Sabourin &amp; Lester, 2014).\"</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.3): Section 3.1.3 introduced<strong> attitude</strong>, the 3rd construct proposed in this literature review (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KY3DI2Q4?page=4\">note on p.338</a>), including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">what is attitude</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the relationship between play and the learning attitude</span>, etc.<em><br /></em></p>\n<p>According to Section 3.1.3:</p>\n<p>\"The attitude construct remains one of the main focuses of research within social sciences, since it is widely accepted attitudes are relevant for understanding and foreseeing social behaviour (Ajzen 2001). An attitude is a behaviour pattern that shows a predisposition to adjust to designated social situations, a conditioned response to certain stimuli that lead to social experiences (LaPiere 1934).</p>\n<p><br />The attitude to education can be either positive or negative; the latter usually occurs when students are not involved in the teaching process of which they are part. This is usually an indicator of school dropout because, when students are involved in the school activities, they tend to persevere in fulfilling their goals, despite whatever challenges and obstacles they may encounter (Saeed &amp; Zyngier 2012).</p>\n<p><br />The relationship between teachers and students is an important factor through which it is possible to study involvement. A peaceful and cooperative relationship between students who perform the activities that are assigned to them and the teachers who encourage them to excel leads to a deeper involvement and fosters academic achievement (Sagayadevan &amp; Jeyaraj 2012), either directly or indirectly (Fullarton 2002; LaNasa et al. 2009; Willekens &amp; Gibson 2010). However, performing the designated tasks is not enough to identify the students’ involvement (Parsons &amp; Taylor 2011).</p>\n<p>Thus, by including game-based elements and mechanisms into the teaching process, using GBL, it is possible to ensure the students’ deeper involvement and their interest, since there is a strong relationship between play and the learning attitude (Bisson &amp; Luckner 1996; Prensky 2001; Shernoff et al. 2003). It is, then, acknowledged that gamification increases the students’ involvement and participation in the teaching-learning process (Hamari, Koivisto &amp; Pakkanen 2014; Barata et al. 2013), and that scoring, difficulty levels, classification, challenges and rewards are its most consensual elements. \"</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.4): Section 3.1.4 introduced <strong>perceived learning</strong>, the 4th construct proposed in this literature review (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/KY3DI2Q4?page=5\">note on p.339</a>), including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the importance of teaching</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">what kind of teaching method will have impact on perceived learning</span>, etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to Section 3.1.4:</p>\n<p>\"Being important elements of the teaching-learning process, teachers play an important role in their students’<br /> education, in their process of acquiring an identity and in their development as members of a society and future professionals (Willemse et al. 2005). The students’  positive thinking about which of the methods used by teachers are the most experiential and interactive (Frontczak 1998; Mayer 2003; Brown &amp; Lee 1994) is a precious indicator of a pedagogy of affection that helps students understand theoretical and practical knowledge theydepend on to improve their learning (Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, &amp; Willingham, 2013) .</p>\n<p><br />The use of teaching methods that are aligned with the students’ preferences and needs helps them develop more favourable attitudes to the acquisition of  knowledge, feel more fulfilled, and reach higher levels of<br />performance (Paswan &amp; Young 2002; Young et al. 2003; Sendaug &amp; Odabacsi 2009).</p>\n<p><br />Teachers who favour qualitatively efficient teaching methods, who choose well-structured and well organised contents capable of engaging students, have a greater impact on perceived learning, besides being more recognised and well-liked (Abrantes et al. 2007). \"</p>",

      "abstractNote": "Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, endanger about half of the world’s population. Their spread is affected by individual behavior in our mostly urban society. Public health policies generally include awareness campaigns on the control of the vectors. While game-based initiatives are developed and used to train students and professionals, support patients and educate citizens, public health education remains neglected. In this study, we identify game-based approaches to support education about diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. We carried out a systematic mapping to identify studies which address a proposal, use or contain an evaluation of game-based methods, aiming to raise awareness and promote behavior changes regarding dengue and its prevention. Only 12 papers met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and those were selected and categorized. As part of an ongoing project, next steps include adding other databases and other mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., malaria) and drafting guidelines to support the design of games for public health education about mosquito-borne diseases. © 2018, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

Many universities are starting to change the way of learning by incorporating elements of the game and using different learning tools that have game elements in the learning process. Therefore, this article will further discuss which elements of the game have been used most in gamification learning and the impact of applying gamification learning to students. This study used systematic literature review approach using articles published in 2014-2018. Can be found if points, badges and leaderboard are the three main elements that are widely used in gamification learning. © IAEME Publication.",

      "abstractNote": "This systematic literature review aims to (a) understand the current state of gamification as a strategy for improving processes associated with software project management and (b) define future gamification in the context of software project management. For these purposes, we identified and analyzed studies based on research interests, including software project management areas explored with gamification, gamification elements used in this context, research methods, and industry type. Our findings indicate a predominance of studies in project management areas related to integration, resources, and scoping. The most commonly reported research method is the solution proposal, and the most commonly used gamification element is the point system. Future research must focus on addressing unexplored project management areas, which can be intervened with gamification as an improvement strategy to facilitate the implementation of good practices that impact the success of software development projects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

      "abstractNote": "Knowledge strongly affects attitudes toward waste management; thus, embedding an environmental mentality at a young age is crucial. Game-based interventions, such as gamification and game-based learning, have huge potential to be effective learning tools. This paper examines the potential of gamification to improve waste management practices among schoolchildren through a narrative review of 25 papers on gamification for waste management and gamification for schoolchildren. The effectiveness of game-based learning and gamification in mitigating waste management issues with schoolchildren has not yet been well-described in the literature; however, the evolving market in related sectors is a strong indication of their potential. A robust understanding of social and behavioral theories is necessary for implementing gamification and game-based learning effectively. Additionally, the game elements, design, and mechanics that can achieve the most positive impacts should be explored further. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the body of knowledge in the environmental sector on gamification as an innovative process for improving household-level waste management behavior among schoolchildren. © IJTech 2018.",

Only the methods can be varieties depends on the instructors. Nowadays, the interest-growing topic in education is about gamification. Various approach has been introduced through gamification to engage student learning but there is still criticism of gamification. Thus, this paper will present an analysis of the existing gamification elements applied in teaching and learning to enhance learning engagement. A survey of the literature was conducted to analyze the existing gamification elements applied in teaching and learning. A deep search of academic literature was undertaken includes books, journals, conference paper, articles, dissertations and theses. Suggestions on how to integrate gamification environment are also included in order to propose new model of engaging online student using gamification elements.",

      "abstractNote": "Serious games and gamification to engage consumers in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency are in their infancy. To date, despite growing interest and some initial attempts, their potential to engage consumers in energy efficiency behaviours has been understudied. To provide an overview of serious games and gamification to engage individuals in pro-environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 10 papers were included in this systematic review. Results showed that serious games and gamification have been used in three different areas related to energy efficiency: environmental education, consumption awareness, and pro-environmental behaviours. This review also showed that applied gaming interventions can be used in more than one of these three areas (comprehensive interventions). The main observation to be drawn from this review is that both serious games and gamification can foster energy-saving behaviours and vary widely in terms of type of games and of features that might be appealing and motivating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

      "abstractNote": "The software development process is a set of socio-technical activities to produce software artifacts in which humans play a crucial role. Since it is a people centric activity, factors such as user motivation, engagement, communication and collaboration might constrain these activities. Therefore, software business organizations stand to benefit from adopting different tools and methods in order to overcome these obstacles and to improve their software business processes. Research has been made to increase software quality and enhance the software development process. Alongside these studies, innovative techniques and concepts are beneficial. As a solution, the notion of gamification (i.e. employing game elements in non-gaming contexts) has been introduced to enhance the software development process and overcome the challenges mostly related to human factors. However, the applicability of game elements in the context of software business landscapes is still a controversial issue and not totally proven as of yet. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the benefits of gamification and how game elements affect the software development process. Thus, in this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted in order to investigate the application of game elements both in research and industrial levels of software development and as well as in software business landscapes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

      "abstractNote": "Although MOOCs are being established as a very popular technology to support learning, they are often criticized for their lack of support to active pedagogies and the high drop-out rates. One approach to face this problem is gamification, due to the promising benefits already shown at small-scale environments. Attending to the current and growing use of game elements in MOOCs, this paper presents a systematic literature review of the usage of gamification in MOOCs, aimed at analyzing how gamification is being implemented in MOOCs, and to identify unexplored research opportunities in this field. The results show that gamification is still at an early stage in MOOCs, and it is being implemented in similar ways to those at small scale contexts. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

      "abstractNote": "Over the last 10 years, research on gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has increased in the field of education, due to its potential to enhance learning performance. Yet, the majority of available research rather focuses on the evaluation of motivation and engagement as key dependent variables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to review available studies on gamification, with an exclusive focus on learning performance as the key dependent variable. Through a systematic search and selection process, building on \"Web of Science\" articles and by considering studies between 2000 and 2016 related to gamification and learning, 582 articles were identified. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria, regarding setting (education), study focus (empirical), journal access (full access) and dependent variables (learning performance), resulted in a review of 23 articles meeting the criteria. The analysis of these articles showed how gamification could be linked to a direct increase in learning performance of students. Nevertheless, some studies also reflect weaker statistical differences between being involved or not in a gamified environment. The review analysis results are especially helpful to define a future agenda for gamification research, addressing the following gaps in the literature. First, include mediating and moderating variables to find more empirical research that can prove an indirect effect of gamification on learning performance. Second, carry out additional research that empirically underpins the direct linkage between gamification and learning performance. Third, include specific individual gamification elements to be able to determine explicit differential effects of these elements on learning performance. Fourth, conduct research in a broader range of knowledge fields to develop empirical evidence in the context of other knowledge domains next to computer sciences. Finally, consider involving larger sample and setting up longer experimental interventions, to avoid novelty effects and risks of lack of generalization.",

      "abstractNote": "In recent years, gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has drawn the attention of educators due to the possibility of making learning more motivating and engaging; this led to an increase of research in the field. Despite the availability of literature reviews about gamification and its effects, no work to this date has focused exclusively on Higher Education (HE). Next, worldwide there is an increasing demand for skilled Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals that meet the challenges related to scientific and technological innovations of the 21st Century. This lead to the need of strengthening STEM Higher Education. This brings us to the purpose of this work: presenting a systematic literature review of empirical studies about gamification STEM related Higher Education. This review study started from a systematic mapping design of 'Web of Science' articles, with following inclusion criteria: empirical gamification studies set up in HE, published between 2000 and 2016; focusing on undergraduate or graduate students; in the STEM knowledge field, and set up in authentic settings. An initial search resulted in 562 potentially relevant articles. After applying all selection criteria, only 18 studies could be retained. 12 additional articles were included by analyzing references from earlier literature reviews, resulting in 30 studies to be included. Analysis results show how a combination of game elements (e.g. leaderboards, badges, points and other combinations) positively affects students' performance, attendance, goal orientation and attitude towards mostly computer science related subjects. The analysis results also point at a lack of studies in certain STEM areas, a lack of studies that identify the particular game element associated with the positive differential impact on student performance; a lack of validated psychometric measurements, and lack of focus on student variables that could/should be taken into account as mediating/moderating variables clarifying the impact of gamification in the HE focus on STEM learning and teaching.",

Gamification is increasingly gaining attention among system designers across various industries especially in education due to the benefits associated with its implementation. The adoption of gamification in information systems (IS) education is promising for engaging and motivating students to complete their degree programs. Call for research in this area is particularly on the increase in the IS field. Accordingly, we need to organize the aggregation of research in this area and use common terminologies to promote progressive research practice in the field. In this paper, we use a multi-method approach to systematically review existing research on gamification in IS education to identify common terminologies, identify trends in topics studied, highlight understudied areas, and, thus, present opportunities for future research. The multi-method approach combines classical systematic review method and social network analysis to provide additional insight into the knowledge structure of researchers involved in the gamification of IS education. This review also highlights possible interventions that can improve student retention in IS education through the design of effective gamified courses. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.",

(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=18\">note on p.112</a>) Figure 1 shows that<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> the self-determination theory</span> was the most prominent. (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=19\">note on p.113</a>)</p>\n<p>Along with the theories, the authors also identified the relevant independent variables, control elements, and dependent variables (see Appendix A). The authors also found that although some of the publications lacked a theoretical basis, more than half of the papers had at least one or more strong and clearly defined independent variables, control elements, and/or dependent variables. Only conceptual papers (such as literature reviews and overviews) lacked these elements because they only reviewed or discussed the gamification phenomena.</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(4):  Section 5 introduced the collaborative strategies that are important for brokering ideas across the research domain (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=4\">note on p.98</a>)</p>\n<p>To answer RQ(4), an author network of IS education gamification studies was created, in which the node colors were coded by the authors’ countries (see Figure 2 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=20\">note on p.114</a>)).</p>\n<p>The nodes (n = 175) in the network represent authors, and the links between them represent co-authorship connections. In total, there were 52 female authors (represented as circles) and 123 male authors (represented as squares).</p>\n<p>At the node level, the authors came from a total of 27 individual countries based on their location when they published their studies (see Table 7 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=21\">note on p.115</a>)). Most authors resided in the USA, Germany, and Australia; the fewest resided in France, New Zealand, Qatar, Slovenia, and Sweden.</p>\n<p>As Table 8 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/W4UVTB7N?page=21\">note on p.115</a>) illustrates, Nacke, the most important scholar in the network of IS education gamification researchers, was connected to authors from five other countries, which avails him the opportunity to broker knowledge across geographical boundaries and potentially across topical areas as well. A similar pattern was observed with Deterding (the second of the top five authors). Consequently, <strong>international collaborations can be beneficial for gamification research in IS education as it avails scholars with varying pedagogical standards to exchange interesting ideas that will lead to a global yet concise understanding of the topic.</strong></p>",

Because the AIS and ACM libraries contain a comprehensive list of papers also indexed in reputable databases for academic publications, we used them to search for papers. Table 1 summarizes the number of papers we found in each journal and conference proceedings.

However, despite its importance, the identification of significant gamification requirements for educational software is not trivial and a consensus of such requirements has not been reached. Motivated by this situation, the objective of this paper is to present a gamification requirements catalog for educational software. The requirements were identified from a systematic literature review, subsequently prioritized and validated through a survey conducted with 64 experts in the field. The results suggest that the requirements of the catalog are important to be applied in educational software. © 2017 ACM.",

Today, online-based learning is offered by many higher education institutions and commercial industries. A variety of strategies to increase student motivation approach on online-based learning has been studied, one of them by using gamification approach. Previous researches were found to adopt motivational theories to stimulate the intrinsic and extrinsic level of gamification approach in education, According to the promise of gamification to enhance the intrinsic motivation of students based on elements of motivation through online-based learning, in this research, we focus on examining; 1) How the application of gamification in online-based learning is, 2) what game design elements that exist in the gamified-based online learning are, and 3) how to increase student motivation in gamified-online learning based on intrinsic motivation elements. The results of our study showed that gamification on online based learning increased, both regarding to utilization, approaches, methods, testing and determination of game design elements are used. Gamification also gave positive impact on student motivation in learning, although it depended on various factors and conditions. We provided reviews and examples based on the literature for the designer in determining the game design elements based on intrinsic motivation elements in the online-based learning. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1): Gamification approach to resolve the problem on the online-based learning is growing. Issues raised varied, such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">levels drop rates, engagements, motivation, learning experiences and performance, the effectiveness and impact of gamification and game design elements</span> in online learning based on age, gender,personal traits, gaming personalities and subject.<strong> E-learning became the most widely disseminated platform by researchers related to efforts to improve students' motivation</strong> with the most widely chosen subjects in software engineering and programming courses. Researchers used various theoretical approaches.</p>\n<p>One of the most widely used theories was <strong>Self-Determination Theory</strong> (SDT). Four researchers proposed and tested the new framework.</p>\n<p>Most of researchers used <strong>quantitative methods</strong> in testing by distributing questionnaires and analyzing data from the experiment results.

      "abstractNote": "Gamification evolved to one of the most important trends in technology and therefore gains more and more practical and scientific notice. Yet academia lacks a comprehensive overview of research, even though a review of prior, relevant literature is essential for advancing knowledge in a field. Therefore a novel classification framework for Gamification in Information Systems with the intention to provide a structured, summarized as well as organized overview was constructed to close this gap of research. A literature review on Gamification in quality outlets combined with a Grounded Theory approach served as a starting point. As a result this paper provides a foundation for current and future research to advance the knowledge on Gamification. Moreover it offers a structure for Gamification research which was not available previously. Findings from the literature review were mapped to the classification framework and analyzed. Derived from the classification framework and its outcome future research outlets were identified.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a well-known approach that refers to the use of game design elements in information systems to make monotonous and tedious tasks more enjoyable. However, research and practice show that game design elements are oftentimes chosen and integrated in information systems randomly, therefore impeding the outcomes of such systems. In this regard, taxonomies can guide system developers, i.e., in selecting and combining game design elements to gamify their information system. Nonetheless, existing taxonomies do not provide such guidance for gamifying information systems. Therefore, the goal of our research is to consolidate the state of the art of gamification research and rigorously develop a gamification taxonomy. To achieve our goal, we conducted a systematic literature review and developed a taxonomy based on a rigorous taxonomy development process. We evaluate our theory by providing evidence of its feasibility with two practical cases: First, we show how the taxonomy helps to analyze existing gamification approaches, and, second, how the taxonomy guides to gamify information systems. Overall, we enrich theory by introducing a new taxonomy to better explain the meaning and characteristics of game design elements. Likewise, practitioners will be guided in selecting and combining game design elements for their gamification approaches. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

Users can collect badges and miles (points) which address their extrinsic motivation. Comparing with others in a leaderboard or seeing the own progress in a progress bar addresses a user’s intrinsic motivation.<em> (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/AAP5YV7B?page=10\">note on p.10</a>)</em></p>\n<p>An overview about the used game mechanics and the characteristics that are addressed with these mechanics is provided in \"Figure 3 Game Mechanics in Nike+\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/AAP5YV7B?page=10\">note on p.10</a>).

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1.3): The authors used<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> a mobile learning application for vocational students of the automotive area</span> to answer RQ(1.3). (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/AAP5YV7B?page=11\">note on p.11</a>) They used the developed taxonomy, to identify the most suitable game mechanics for the mobile learning application. </p>\n<p>Overall, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">intrinsic motivating</span> components have more positive effects on the quality of a student's learning outcomes than extrinsic motivating components. Thus, the authors decided to ground their gamification concept on intrinsic motivating game mechanics. Besides using points and badges, all of the game mechanics are designed to intrinsically motivate the student users.  (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/AAP5YV7B?page=12\">note on p.12</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>5 Game mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>(1)<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tasks</span>:  integrate tasks and badges into the mobile learning application.

Out of the papers found by using the keywords \"gamification\" and \"game design elements\", 89 papers remained as relevant for the analysis.

      "abstractNote": "Engagement is a key reason for introducing gamification to learning and thus serves as an important measurement of its effectiveness. Based on a literature review and meta-synthesis, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework of engagement in gamification for learning. The framework sketches out the connections among gamification strategies, dimensions of engagement, and the ultimate learning outcome. It also elicits other task - and user - related factors that may potentially impact the effect of gamification on learner engagement. To verify and further strengthen the framework, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that: 1) different gamification strategies can trigger different facets of engagement; 2) the three dimensions of engagement have varying effects on skill acquisition and transfer; and 3) task nature and learner characteristics that were overlooked in previous studies can influence the engagement process. Our framework provides an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of gamification for learning, and can serve as a theoretical foundation for future research and design. © Copyright 2016 ACM.",

      "abstractNote": "The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. The systematic mapping study identified 106 primary studies describing the use of serious games, gamification and game development in software engineering education. Based on this mapping, we aimed to track the learning goals of each primary study to the knowledge areas defined in ACM/IEEE curricular recommendations. As a result, we observed that 'Software Process', 'Software Design' and 'Profession Practice' are the most recurring knowledge areas explored by game related approaches in software engineering education. We also uncover possible research opportunities for game-related education methods. © 2017 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a popular design approach with the purpose to increase engagement and continuous use of Health Behaviour Change Support Systems (HBCSS) with the purpose to establish health and wellbeing. It is widely employed for promoting healthier life choices or for supporting people with chronic diseases in their daily activities. Yet, there is a lack of evidence concerning gamification and its ability to sustain favourable effects on health behaviour change. This paper presents a scoping review about the long-term perspective in gamified HBCSS, focusing primarily on IT-reliant systems that treat individual lifestyle habits like healthy nutrition, exercise or smoking cessation. We systematically selected studies that consider gamified HBCSS for health promotion and discuss to what extent long-term engagement is explicitly included in their design. Our results underline a deficit of consideration of the long-term perspective as well as a lack of measurement related to the lasting effects of gamification. We therefore propose to intensify the use of longitudinal and prospective observational studies in the context of HBCSS, in order to increase the level of evidence of gamification interventions. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

      "abstractNote": "The ubiquitous presence of technology in classrooms has inspired a shift from traditional classroom lectures to integrated digital learning environments. These interactive learning environments present the opportunity to evolve the teaching process through the incorporation of game elements that have been shown to capture user attention, motivate towards goals, and promote competition, effective teamwork, and communication. Gamification and game-based learning systems aim to bring these benefits into the learning and teaching process. This paper presents a systematic literature review of game-based learning systems, frameworks that integrate game design elements, and various implementations of gamification in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in education for this review. The objective is to identify how gamified learning systems can be used and categorize its usefulness in higher education. The findings of this literature review allow higher education universities to employ and explore efficient gamified learning and teaching systems to improve student engagement, motivation, and performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

Although improved student performance was observed in some studies, others showed that gamification improved perceived learning and enjoyment but did not significantly improve performance. As the studies differed significantly in the contexts of their application, the results on student performance are not conclusive.The key findings of the papers on gamification are presented in Table 2 (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/AQG63SCH?page=7\">note on p.198</a>).</p>",

The literature review on game-based learning in higher education found that levels, graphics, points, leaderboard, and badges were the most used game elements in games for higher education. Improved student engagement, attitudes, and performance were the most significant benefits observed from the use of game-based learning applications. Enjoyment, increased motivation, and improved perceived learning were some of the other important benefits observed in studies on game-based learning. Gamified learning systems in the form of mobile and computer applications, serious games, and 3D simulation labs were used or developed in studies of this category.

A lot of research is ongoing since it seeks to improve the quality of learning of students. Current situation on research of \"Gamification in education\" is still at initial stages where all of them aim to improve the effectiveness of education activity using game elements. Several gaps on the studiesdone on gamification in education have been identified. In this paper, we seek to answer the following questions; \"how can we make education more interesting?\" and \"what is the role of gamification in adult learning process?\" by method of literature review. © 2014 Garamkhand Surendeleg, Violet Murwa, Han-Kyung Yun and Yoon Sang Kim.",

        "<p>Answer to RQ(1): Section 4.1 answers the RQ(1): \"How can we make education more interesting?\".</p>\n<p>In traditional instructional methodology the lecture classes are perceived to be boring by students.To make education more interesting, educators should increase students' motivation.There are many methods available to increase students’ engagement where <strong>motivation</strong> is one of them. According to<strong> Fogg’s behavioral model (FBM)</strong>, gamification focuses on learner’s motivation to reach a desired behavioral change which is the main purpose of instruction. This model is a product of three factors; <strong>Motivation (be sufficiently motivated), Ability or simplicity (have the ability to perform the behavior) and Triggers (be triggered to perform the behavior)</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition, <strong>Game elements</strong> are used as <strong>intrinsic and extrinsic factors</strong> to increase learner’s motivation. Each element has its own function that affects student’s behavior. The usage of game elements or game mechanics design depends on the system’s main contexts and purposes. In general the most used elements in gamified applications are feedbacks, leaderboards, points, and levels. The key advantage of gamification is the low cost of development and the possibility of making learning content more ‘delicious’ or ‘interesting’ using game elements.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/8AI5LB5S?page=4\">note on p.1612</a>)</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(2): Section 4.2 answers the RQ(2): \"What is the role of gamification in learning process?\"</p>\n<p><strong>1. Enhanced learning</strong><br />Gamification not only engages students but also brings about learning situations and conditions that builds understanding through immediate and instructive feedback loops. It is revealed that empirical evidence exists that games can be effective tools for enhancing learning and understanding complex subject matter</p>\n<p><strong>2. Student Engagement</strong><br />Gamification can play a big role when we incorporate into the learning process by enhancing student engagement, learning and through this student’s motivation levels are increased. The overall effect therefore is improved quality of learning and results.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/groups/2366342/items/8AI5LB5S?page=4\">note on p.1612</a>)</p>",

      "abstractNote": "A stroke is a life-changing event that may end up as a disability, with repercussions on the patient’s quality of life. Stroke rehabilitation therapies are helpful to regain some of the patient’s lost functionality. However, in practice stroke patients may suffer from a gradual loss of motivation. Gamified systems are used to increase user motivation, hence, gamified elements have been implemented into stroke rehabilitation therapies in order to improve patients’ engagement and adherence. This review work focuses on selecting and analyzing developed and validated gamified stroke rehabilitation systems published between 2009 and 2017 to identify the most important features of these systems. After extensive research, 32 articles have met the selection criteria, resulting in a total of 28 unique works. The works were analyzed and a total of 20 features were identified. The features are explained, making emphasis on the works that implement them extensively. Finally, a classification of features based on objectives is proposed, which was used to identify the relationships between features and implementation gaps. It was found that there is a tendency to develop low-cost solutions as in-home therapy systems and provide a variety of games. This review allowed the definition of the opportunities for future research direction such as systems addressing the three rehabilitation areas; data analytics to make decisions; motivational content identification based on automatic engagement detection and emotion recognition; and alert systems for patient´s safety.",

      "abstractNote": "Information technologies have introduced several changes in teaching and learning environments. In this scenario, the gamification technique emerges as a promising approach, considering the impact on the students’ motivation and appealing to their participation. This paper describes a systematic review addressing gamification in virtual learning environments (VLE), presenting an overview on how gamification has been applied in these scenarios. This review was based on papers published in highly scored journals in the field of computers in education. The papers were selected according to the gamification theme, and the content was analyzed and a state of the art built, according to the retrieved qualitative data. The results seem to reveal that there are significant gains derived from the adoption of gamification in VLE. However, some gains are not unanimous and it depends on how the elements are applied. This paper also suggests a basis for future work aiming at applying gamification in a VLE. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",

However, there is a lack of primary and secondary studies that explore the negative effects that gamification may have on learners, and lack of studies that analyze the gamification design that are linked to those negative effects. Based on this premise, we aim at answering the following research question “What are the negative effects that can occur in gamification when applied to educational contexts?”. We seek to answer this question by analyzing the negative effects that are associated to gamification and the gamified learning design that are linked with them. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic mapping study to identify these negative effects. Based on the studies that were analyzed, we identified and mapped 4 negative effects and their gameful design. Loss of Performance was the most occurring effect and Leaderboard the most cited game design element, among other 11 elements. Moreover, elements and effects were linked in order to identify how these elements may have influenced on these outcomes. Based on our results, we found out that the game design may lead to a negative impact. For instance, Leaderboards are strongly associated to many negative effects mapped in this work. This result is corroborated by the psychology literature regarding ranking systems within learning environments. We believe our work may be useful to guide gamification instructors and specialists to avoid those negative effects in education contexts, by avoiding some game design elements settings. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamification is a novel concept that has attracted the attention of many research fields, including software engineering, software process improvement or software process standards education as an approach to increase productivity, engagement, and motivation of participants involved in a system, site or business. However, gamification is a relative new concept that needs to deal with many problems in order to consolidate and mature its understanding and process. The main goal of this study is to explore the gamification scope with the goal to identify its problems and needs, focusing on the monitoring process of gamification strategies. A systematic literature review was performed following a predefined procedure that involves automatically searching in scientific digital databases. 383 papers were found by the automatic searches in the digital databases and only 2 papers were selected as primary studies. Outcomes show that there is a clear scope of research on the road to provide tools for monitoring high-scalable gamified systems that support gamification experts on gamification analytics and end-users on getting real-time feedback, as well as, a need to mature the gamification process that can be supported by taking advantages from other disciplines, especially from the scope of process capability and maturity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",

      "abstractNote": "Requirement engineering (RE) presents several challenges stemming from the required collaboration and knowledge transfer between analysists, developers and customers. Motivation theories have been used occasionally to analyze and encourage motivation and engagement of stakeholders in RE tasks. In recent years, gamification techniques have been used in software engineering tasks, and in some cases, in RE tasks in order to promote stakeholder engagement. This paper presents a preliminary literature review that was conducted in order to model correlations documented in literature between RE tasks, stakeholder motivation and engagement, and gamification. The preliminary findings show promise for conducting a full systematic literature review (SLR) in order to complete modeling existing evidence-based literature. The SLR and the emergent model will set the grounds for a research agenda toward an exhaustive model that will offer guidance for designing gamified environments for different RE tasks, based on motivational and behavioral factors. © 2018 ACM.",

      "abstractNote": "Gamified software is currently very popular, and it is expected that it will be widely adopted over the coming years. The social impact of gamified software will probably be very high, and we therefore believe that the assessment and improvement of gamified software quality may be necessary. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic mapping study (SMS) carried out to discover the current state of the research on software gamification quality, in order to identify gaps that merit rigorous future investigation. This SMS allowed us to select 35 papers found in five digital libraries up to April 2014. This paper summarizes the main issues of the planning and the conducting of the SMS. The main results of the data synthesis are detailed and future work is also outlined. © 2015 IEEE.",

Papers whose  outcome is \"knowledge\" do not present something whose result is “tangible” but rather use empirical studies to confirm whether gamification works, and the outcome of the research in these papers is the “knowledge” about the evidence acquired. With regard to the “framework”, 3 papers are presented for the design of gamified applications (P1, P3, P13), one for the design of gamification elements (P22), and one (P33) is a conceptual framework that can be used to explore purchase intentions.</p>",
        "<p>Answer to RQ(4): Pg. 5. \" The results showed that 32 (all papers excluding P3 and P22, or 91.43%) papers dealt with gamified software quality after the product had been developed, or when a final version was ready. Only 2 (7.69%) papers dealt with the gamified software quality at the design stage. One paper presents a framework based on Bartle’s [1] model of player types and on Maslow’s [17] hierarchy of needs, and is intended to evaluate the engagement potential of a game design by mapping player motivations onto the various game mechanics (P3), while the other is a framework consisting of a definition of “game achievement” and a three-part model for the evaluation and design of game achievements (P22). As additional results we found that 57.14% of the implementations of the gamified approach are carried out along with the development of the application whilst in 42.86% of the cases this is done by means of a plug-in. \"</p>",

      "abstractNote": "The conception of the term gamification has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners, it is still unclear with proliferation of groundless arguments, and no work to date has surveyed as a study from a healthcare perspective. This study correlates the existing arguments from academic researches and healthcare practices into a systematic review. The focus is on assessing the findings of the quality literatures, such that the predecessors' contributions of applying gamification to healthcare system are illuminated. The findings show that the development of gamification for healthcare system is still preliminary; the most popular research topic is to motivate users by a human-computer interface with a game element such as points. We discuss the results along with an identification of opportunities for future research as a contribution of this systematic review. We suggest that gamification can be more than gaming; it can be a mechanism to enable happier working experience for medical works. © 2015 IEEE.",

      "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Automatic biases, such as attentional biases and avoidance and interpretative biases, have been purported to be responsible for several psychiatric disorders. Gamification has been considered for cognitive bias modification, mainly to address the core issues of diminishing motivation to train over time, as bias modification intervention tasks tend to be highly repetitive. While a prior review has suggested how gamification strategies could be applied to such tasks, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of gamified cognitive bias modification interventions in the literature.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to understand the overall effectiveness of a gamified approach for cognitive bias modification and inform future research that seeks to integrate gamification technologies into existing conventional bias modification interventions.\nMETHODS: To identify the relevant articles for our review, the following search terminologies were used: (\"cognitive bias\" OR \"attention bias\" OR \"interpret* bias\" OR \"approach bias\" OR \"avoidance bias\") AND (\"training\" OR \"modification\" OR \"practice\" OR \"therapy\") AND (\"gamification\" OR \"game elements\" OR \"game\" OR \"gaming\" OR \"game mechanics\"). PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched systematically for articles published after 2000. Articles were included if they described a gamified cognitive bias modification task and included participants with underlying psychopathological symptoms. Data were systematically extracted from the identified articles, and a qualitative synthesis was performed.\nRESULTS: Four studies evaluated gamified cognitive bias modification interventions. Two studies included participants with anxiety symptoms, one with affective symptoms, and one with alcohol problems. The conventional visual probe task paradigm was used in 3 studies, and the attentional visual search task paradigm was used in the last study. We found gaming elements incorporated to include that of animations, sounds, feedback, and a point-scoring system for response time and difficulty. Of the 4 identified studies, only 2 reported their gamified interventions to be effective.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our review is the first to systematically synthesize the evidence for gamified cognitive bias modification interventions. The results arising from our review should be considered in the future design and conceptualization of gamified cognitive bias modification interventions.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/10154.",

The findings indicate that the execution and control of production and logistic processes has been addressed most often in the current body of literature, which mostly consists of design research. Objectives and goals, points, achievements, multimedial feedback, metaphorical or fictional representations, and levels and progress are currently the most often employed affordances within this field. Research has focused in the given context on examining or considering motivation, enjoyment and flow, as the main psychological outcomes of gamification, while individual performance and efficiency are the most commonly examined or suggested behavioral and organizational impacts. Future studies should employ more rigorous designs within new subdomains of production and logistics and should firmly ground research designs and discussions in management theory and critical studies.",
